'''Alexander of Hales''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]}} (also '''Halensis''', '''Alensis''', '''Halesius''', '''Alesius''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|iː|s|i|ə|s}}; {{circa|1185}}{{spaced ndash}}21 August 1245), also called ''Doctor Irrefragibilis'' (by [[Pope Alexander IV]] in the ''Bull De Fontibus Paradisi'') and ''Theologorum Monarcha'', was a theologian and philosopher important in the development of [[Scholasticism]] and of the [[Franciscan]] School.

==Life==
Alexander was born at Hales, [[Shropshire]] (today [[Halesowen]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]), [[England]], between 1180 and 1186. He came from a rather wealthy country family. He studied at the [[University of Paris]] and became a master of arts sometime before 1210.{{sfn|Cullen|2006|p=105}} He began to read theology in 1212 or 1213, and became a [[regent master]] in 1220 or 1221. He introduced the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]] as the basic textbook for the study of theology. During the University strike of 1229, Alexander participated in an embassy to Rome to discuss the place of Aristotle in the curriculum. Having held a prebend at Holborn (prior to 1229) and a canonry of St. Paul's in London (1226-1229), he visited England in 1230 and received a canonry and an archdeaconry in Coventry and Lichfield, his native diocese. He taught at Paris in the academic year 1232–33, but was appointed to a delegation by Henry III of England in 1235, along with Simon Langton and Fulk Basset, to negotiate the renewal of the peace between England and France.

In 1236 or 1237, aged about 50, Alexander entered the [[Franciscan]] Order, having previously considered both the Cistercians and the Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wshYVi3KM4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA246-IA1&amp;lpg=RA1-PA246-IA1&amp;dq=Albert+of+Pisa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mxGwNqGdbm&amp;sig=ACfU3U00LUW1A4CWfBTnQgmJk8hAOnEnVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRoPb64uvmAhUOrVkKHcFbDxI4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Albert%20of%20Pisa&amp;f=false Arnald of Sarrant. ''Chronicle of the Twenty-Four Generals of the Order of Friars Minor'', (Noel Muscat ofm, trans.) Ordo Fratrum Minorum. Malta, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; He thus became the first Franciscan friar to hold a University chair. His doctrinal positions became the starting point of the Franciscan school of theology. He continued to teach and to represent the University, and participated in the [[First Council of Lyon]] in the winter of 1245.

After returning to Paris, Alexander fell ill, probably due to an epidemic then sweeping the city. Shortly before his death, he passed his chair on to [[John of La Rochelle]], setting the precedent for that chair to be held by a Franciscan.{{sfn|Principe|1967|p=14}} Alexander died at Paris on 21 August 1245.

As the first [[Franciscan]] to hold a chair at the [[University of Paris]], Alexander had many significant disciples. He was called ''Doctor Irrefragibilis'' (Irrefutable Teacher) and ''Doctor Doctorum'' (Teacher of Teachers).{{sfn|Brown|Flores|2007|p=10}} The latter title is especially suggestive of his role in forming several Franciscans who later became influential thinkers in the faculty, among them [[Bonaventure]], John of La Rochelle, Odo Rigaldus, William of Middleton and [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall]].{{sfn|Brown|Flores|2007|p=10}} Bonaventure, who may not have sat under Alexander directly, nevertheless referred to Alexander as his &quot;father and master&quot; and wished to &quot;follow in his footsteps.&quot;{{sfn|Cullen|2006|p=105}}

==Works==
[[Image:Alexander - Summa universae theologiae - 4316508.tif|thumb|''Summa universae theologiae'']]
{{Catholic philosophy}}
Alexander is known for reflecting the works of several other Middle Age thinkers, especially those of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]] and [[Saint Augustine]]. He was also known to quote thinkers such as [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]] and [[Richard of Saint-Victor]]. He differs from those in his genre as he is known to reflect his own interests and those of his generation. When using the works of his authorities, Alexander does not only review their reasoning but also gives conclusions, expands on them, and offers his agreements and disagreement with them. He was also different in that he appeals to Pre-Lombardian figures, and in his use of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], whose works were not cited as frequently by other 12th-century scholastics. Aristotle is also quite frequently quoted in Alexander's works. Alexander was fascinated by the Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy of angels and in how their nature can be understood, given Aristotelian [[metaphysics]].{{sfn|Colish|2006}}

Among the doctrines which were specially developed and, so to speak, fixed by Alexander of Hales, are the ''thesaurus supererogationis perfectorum'' ([[Treasury of merit|treasury of supererogatory merits]]) and the ''[[character indelibilis]]'' (sacramental character) of [[baptism]], [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]], and [[Holy Orders|ordination]]. That doctrine had been written about much earlier by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and was eventually defined a [[dogma]] by the [[Council of Trent]]. He also posed an important question about the cause of the [[Incarnation]]: would Christ have been incarnated if humanity had never sinned? The question eventually became the focal point for a philosophical issue (the theory of possible worlds) and a theological topic on the distinction between God's absolute power (''potentia absoluta'') and His ordained power (''potentia ordinata'').

===''Summa Universae Theologiae''===
He had written the summary/commentary of Peter Lombard's four books of the ''Sentences''. It had exposed the trinitarian theology of the Greeks.{{sfn|Backus|1997|p=301}} This had been the most important writing that Alexander had claimed, and it had been the earliest in the genre. While it is common for scholars to state that Alexander was the first to write a commentary on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], it is not quite accurate. Authorship is more contentious for this work; although he started this work, he died before it could be finished, and it most likely was more a product of people other than Alexander.{{sfn|Beiting|1999|p=5}} There were a number of &quot;commentaries&quot; on the ''Sentences'', but Alexander's appears to have been the first magisterial commentary. Although it was Alexander's most significant writing, it had not been completed, therefore leaving historians with many questions on the reliability and quality of the writing. This was taken into consideration when the ''Summa'' had been examined by Father Victorin Doucet for different editions of them. The sources has seem to be the resulting problem of the ''Summa'', &quot;counted there were 4814 explicit quotations and 1372 implicit quotations from [[Augustine]], more than one quarter of texts were cited in the body of the ''Summa''.{{sfn|Backus|1997|p=303}}{{Incomprehensible inline|date=March 2016}}

Of Alexander's ''Summa'', which was on one occasion proclaimed by an assembly of seventy doctors to be infallible, [[Roger Bacon]] declared that, though it was as heavy as the weight of a horse, it was full of errors and displayed ignorance of physics, of metaphysics, and even of logic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Seymour Stevenson]], ''Robert Grosseteste: Bishop of Lincoln'' (1899) citing Roger Bacon's ''Opus Minus'' ed. Brewer pp. 325-327 &amp; ''Opus Tertium'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other historical works===
Alexander also influenced and sometimes is confused with [[Alexander Carpenter]], Latinized as ''Fabricius'' (fl. 1429), who was the author of the ''Destructorium viciorum'', a religious work popular in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Robert Owst: ''The Destructorium viciorum of Alexander Carpenter'', Church Historical Society, [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], London, 1952, 40 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter also authored other works, such as &quot;''Homiliae eruditae''&quot; (&quot;Learned Sermons&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Carpenter, Alexander |volume=9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Watson (ed.): ''The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, Volume 1, 600-1660''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974, p. 803.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical contribution==
Alexander was said to have been among the earliest scholastics to engage with Aristotle's newly translated writings.{{sfn|Cullen|2006|p=104}} Between 1220 and 1227, he wrote ''Glossa in quatuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi'' (''A Gloss on the [[Sentences|Four Books of the Sentences]] of [[Peter Lombard]]'') (composed in the mid-12th century), which was particularly important because it was the first time that a book other than the Bible was used as a basic text for theological study.{{sfn|Brown|Flores|2007|p=10}} This steered the development of scholasticism in a more systematic direction,{{sfn|Brown|Flores|2007|p=10}} inaugurating an important tradition of writing commentaries on the ''Sentences'' as a fundamental step in the training of master theologians.

===A medieval scholastic===
In doing so, he elevated Lombard's work from a mere theological resource to the basic framework of questions and problems from which masters could teach. The commentary (or more correctly titled a ''Gloss'') survived in student reports from Alexander's teaching in the classroom and so it provides a major insight into the way theologians taught their discipline in the 1220s. As is the case with ''Glossa'' and ''Quaestiones Disputatae'', much of his work is probably written in the form of notes on his oral teachings by students, though the content is definitely his.{{sfn|Principe|1967|p=20}}

For his contemporaries, however, Alexander's fame was his inexhaustible interest in disputation.  His disputations prior to his becoming a Franciscan cover over 1,600 pages in their modern edition.  His disputed questions after 1236 remain unpublished.  Alexander was also one of the first scholastics to participate in the ''Quodlibetal'', a university event in which a master had to respond to any question posed by any student or master over a period of three days.  Alexander's ''Quodlibetal questions'' also remain unedited.

===Theologian===
At the beginning of 1236, he entered the Franciscan order (he was at least 50) and was the first Franciscan to hold a chair at the University of Paris.{{sfn|Cullen|2006|p=104}} He held this post until shortly before his death in Paris in 1245.{{sfn|Principe|1967|p=14}} When he became a Franciscan and thus created a formal Franciscan school of theology at Paris, it was soon clear that his students lacked some of the basic tools for the discipline.  Alexander responded by beginning a ''Summa theologiae'' that is now known as the ''Summa fratris Alexandri''.  Alexander drew mainly from his own disputations, but also selected ideas, arguments and sources from his contemporaries.  It treats in its first part the doctrines of [[God]] and his attributes; in its second, those of [[creation myth|creation]] and [[sin]]; in its third, those of [[Salvation|redemption]] and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]; and, in its fourth and last, those of the [[sacrament]]s. This massive text, which [[Roger Bacon]] would later sarcastically describe as weighing as much as a horse, was unfinished at his death; his students, William of Middleton and John of Rupella, were charged with its completion.  It was certainly read by the Franciscans at Paris, including [[Bonaventure]].

Alexander was an innovative theologian. He was part of the generation that first grappled with the writings of [[Aristotle]].  While there was a ban on using Aristotle's works as teaching texts, theologians like Alexander continued to exploit his ideas in their theology.  Two other uncommon sources were promoted by Alexander: [[Anselm of Canterbury]], whose writings had been ignored for almost a century, gained an important advocate in Alexander and he used Anselm's works extensively in his teaching on [[Christology]] and [[soteriology]]; and, [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], whom Alexander used in his examination of the theology of Orders and ecclesiastical structures.

Though he also continued the tradition of Aristotle- and Augustine-focused thought in the Franciscan school, he did so through an [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]-directed lens.{{sfn|Cullen|2006|p=104}} In fact, Alexander was one of the major influences for the advancement of Anselmian thought in the 13th century.{{sfn|Cullen|2006|p=104}} One such example is the idea of original sin as a lack of justice. Alexander believed that original sin is both a punishment as well as a cause for punishment.{{sfn|Beiting|1999|p=13}} That is to say, the body is corrupt, but the soul is clean. Alexander advances the idea that it would not be God's fault to create a being that would bind the ‘corrupt’ with the ‘clean’.{{sfn|Beiting|1999|p=7}} He advanced a highly original response that the soul naturally desires the body.{{sfn|Beiting|1999|p=8}} Consequently, God is both merciful in giving the soul what it wants, as well as just in punishing the soul for binding with the corrupt flesh. Either the soul knew that the body was corrupt, or it did not (in which case it would be “laboring under ignorance”); both of these considerations are cause for divine punishment.{{sfn|Beiting|1999|p=8}}

Alexander is also known for rejecting the idea that there are many things in God's mind, instead claiming that it is more perfect to know just one thing.{{sfn|Wood|1993|p=8}} He did not start off with this view, though. In the ''Glossa'', he openly suggests the idea of the multiplicity of divine ideas.{{sfn|Wood|1993|p=8}} In his later work, ''Quaestio disputata antequam erat Frater 46'', he finally rejects the plurality of divine ideas, and this theme continues through the rest of his works.{{sfn|Wood|1993|p=9}} Specifically, in one of his last works, ''De scientia divina'', he concludes that the idea of [[wikt:plurality|plurality]] itself is strictly temporal, a human notion.{{sfn|Wood|1993|p=13}}

One of his more famous works, the ''Summa'', is important because of its system for determining if a [[Just war theory|war is just]].{{sfn|Russell|2014|p=602}} There are six requirements for determining this: authority and attitude (in reference to who declares the war), intention and condition (in reference to the soldiers), merit (of the enemy) and just cause.{{sfn|Russell|2014|p=602}} Just cause becomes the overarching moral principle for declaring war in three ways: the relief of good people, coercion of the wicked, and peace for all.{{sfn|Russell|2014|p=603}} It is important to note that Alexander put ‘peace for all’ at the end of the list to amplify its importance.{{sfn|Russell|2014|p=603}}

'''Active Server Pages''' ('''ASP''') is [[Microsoft]]'s first [[server-side scripting|server-side]] [[Active Scripting|script engine]] for [[dynamic web page|dynamically generated web pages]].

It was first released in December 1996, before being superseded in January 2002 by [[ASP.NET]].

== History ==
Initially released as an add-on to [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS) via the [[Windows NT 4.0#Option Pack|Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack]] (ca. 1996), it is included as a component of [[Windows Server]] (since the initial release of [[Windows 2000 Server]]). There have been three versions of ASP, each introduced with different versions of IIS:

* ASP 1.0 was released on December 1996 as part of IIS 3.0
* ASP 2.0 was released on September 1997 as part of IIS 4.0
* ASP 3.0 was released on November 2000 as part of IIS 5.0

ASP 2.0 provides six built-in [[Object (computer science)|objects]]: Application, ASPError, Request, Response, Server, and Session. &lt;code&gt;Session&lt;/code&gt; object, for example, represents a [[Session (computer science)|session]] that maintains the state of [[Variable (programming)|variables]] from page to page.&lt;ref&gt;The session data is kept server-side, the ID is saved as a [[HTTP Cookie]]. Source: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972338.aspx ASP and Web Session Management], Microsoft&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Active Scripting]] engine's support of the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) enables ASP [[website]]s to access functionality in compiled [[Library (computing)|libraries]] such as [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]].

ASP 3.0 does not differ greatly from ASP 2.0 but it does offer some additional enhancements such as Server.Transfer method, Server.Execute method, and an enhanced ASPError object. ASP 3.0 also enables buffering by default and optimized the engine for better performance.

ASP remains supported until 14 January 2020 on [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Server Pages (ASP) support in Windows|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2669020|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=11 August 2015|date=30 January 2012|edition=4.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ASP pages will be supported on [[Windows 8]] for a minimum of 10 years from the [[Windows 8]] release date.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Architecture ==
ASP uses [[server-side scripting]] to generate content that is sent to the client's web browser. The ASP interpreter reads and executes all script code between &lt;% and %&gt; tags, the result of which is content generation. These scripts were written using [[VBScript]], [[JScript]], or [[PerlScript]]. The &lt;code&gt;@Language&lt;/code&gt; directive, the {{tag|script|s|params=language=&quot;manu&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;}} syntax or server configuration can be used to select the language. In the example below, Response.Write Now() is in an [[HTML]] page; it would be dynamically replaced by the current time of the server.
{|
! Server side !! What client receives
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot;
|&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;The server's current time:
&lt;%
Response.Write Now()
%&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
|&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;The server's current time:
8/11/2015 6:24:45 PM&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
|}

Web pages with the ''.asp'' [[filename extension]] use ASP, although some web sites disguise their choice of scripting language for security purposes by using the more common ''.htm'' or ''.html'' extensions. Pages with the ''.aspx'' extension use compiled [[ASP.NET]]; however, ASP.NET pages may still include some ASP scripting. The introduction of ASP.NET led to use of the term ''Classic ASP'' for the original technology.

Sun Java System ASP (formerly ChiliSoft ASP) was a popular and reportedly complete emulator,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weissinger2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Weissinger|first=Keyton |title=ASP in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUHeRwhGKcgC|accessdate=9 October 2013|date=6 October 2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-7959-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been discontinued.

===The Response object===
Can send information to the client, such as the writing of the text on a page or [[HTTP Cookie]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
If Len(Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;)) &gt; 0 Then
     Response.Cookies(&quot;name&quot;) = Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;) 
End If

Response.Write &quot;Welcome &quot; &amp; Server.HTMLEncode(Response.Cookies(&quot;name&quot;)) &amp; &quot;!&quot;
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Server object===
Allows connections to databases (ADO), filesystem, and use of components installed on the server.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
Dim oAdoCon, oAdoRec, oAdoStm, oCdoCon, oCdoMsg, oSciDic, oSciFsm, oMswAdr

Set oAdoCon = Server.CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;)

Set oCdoCon = Server.CreateObject(&quot;CDO.Configuration&quot;)
Set oCdoMsg = Server.CreateObject(&quot;CDO.Message&quot;)
Set oSciDic = Server.CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.Dictionary&quot;)
Set oSciFsm = Server.CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.FileSystemObject&quot;)
Set oMswAdr = Server.CreateObject(&quot;MSWC.Swingbridge&quot;)
%&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Application object===
Stores global variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
Application(&quot;Ali&quot;) = &quot;My ASP Application&quot;
Response.Write &quot;Welcome to &quot; &amp; Server.HTMLEncode(Application(&quot;Ali&quot;)) &amp; &quot;!&quot;
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Session object===
Stores variables accessible only to a single visitor.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
If Len(Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;)) &gt; 0 Then
     Session(&quot;name&quot;) = Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;) 
End If

Response.Write &quot;Welcome &quot; &amp; Server.HTMLEncode(Session(&quot;name&quot;)) &amp; &quot;!&quot;
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Err object===
Allows the management of errors.

&lt;source Lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
On Error Resume Next

Response.Write 1 / 0 ' Division by zero

If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0 Then
     Response.Write &quot;Error Code: &quot; &amp; Server.HTMLEncode(Err.Number) &amp; &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;
     Response.Write &quot;Error Source: &quot; &amp; Server.HTMLEncode(Err.Source) &amp; &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;
     Response.Write &quot;Error Description: &quot; &amp; Server.HTMLEncode(Err.Description) &amp; &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;
     Err.Clear 
End If 
%&gt;

==Medical uses==
[[Image:Amoxicillin.JPG|thumb|right|Amoxicillin [[British Pharmacopoeia|BP]]]]
Amoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections, including [[acute otitis media]], [[streptococcal pharyngitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[Cellulitis|skin infections]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, ''[[Salmonella]]'' infections, [[Lyme disease]], and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] infections.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davisamox&gt;{{cite web | url = http://davisplus.fadavis.com/3976/meddeck/pdf/amoxicillin.pdf | access-date = March 22, 2017 | publisher = Davis | title = Amoxicillin | date = 2017 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908135951/https://davisplus.fadavis.com/3976/meddeck/pdf/amoxicillin.pdf | archivedate = September 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute otitis media===
Children with acute otitis media who are younger than 6 months of age are generally treated with amoxicillin or other antibiotic. Although most children with acute otitis media who are older than two years old do not benefit from treatment with amoxicillin or other antibiotic, such treatment may be helpful in children younger than two years old with acute otitis media that is bilateral or accompanied by ear drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venekamp|first=Roderick P.|last2=Sanders|first2=Sharon L.|last3=Glasziou|first3=Paul P.|last4=Del Mar|first4=Chris B.|last5=Rovers|first5=Maroeska M.|date=2015-06-23|title=Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=6|pages=CD000219|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000219.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26099233|pmc=7043305|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:293244/UQ293244_OA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, amoxicillin was dosed three times daily when used to treat acute otitis media, which resulted in missed doses in routine ambulatory practice.

Amoxicillin is occasionally used for the treatment of skin infections,&lt;ref name = Davisamox/&gt; such as [[acne vulgaris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Adolescent Acne: Management | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430534_5 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101222205124/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430534_5 | archivedate = 2010-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics, such as [[doxycycline]] and [[minocycline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceofacne.com/amoxicillin/ |title=Amoxicillin and Acne Vulgaris |publisher=scienceofacne.com |date=2012-09-05 |accessdate=2012-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721002339/http://scienceofacne.com/amoxicillin/ |archivedate=2012-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infections in infants in resource-limited settings===
Amoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child. Amoxicillin in combination with [[gentamicin]] is recommended for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK321136/|title=Guideline: Managing Possible Serious Bacterial Infection in Young Infants When Referral Is Not Feasible - NCBI Bookshelf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908135935/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK321136/|archivedate=2017-09-08|isbn=9789241509268|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2015|series=WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention of bacterial endocarditis===
It is also used to prevent [[bacterial endocarditis]] in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without [[spleen]]s, such as people with [[sickle-cell disease]], and for both the prevention and the treatment of [[anthrax]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CG64 Prophylaxis against infective endocarditis: Full guidance |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11938/40039/40039.pdf |work=NICE |accessdate=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112000314/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11938/40039/40039.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thornhill |first=MH |last2=Dayer |first2=MJ |last3=Forde |first3=JM |last4=Corey |first4=GR |last5=Chu |first5=VH |last6=Couper |first6=DJ |last7=Lockhart |first7=PB|title=Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study|journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) |date=2011-05-03 |volume=342 |pages=d2392 |pmid=21540258 |doi=10.1136/bmj.d2392 |pmc=3086390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combination treatment===
Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by [[beta-lactamase|β-lactamase]]-producing bacteria, which are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, such as [[penicillin]]. For this reason, it may be combined with [[clavulanic acid]], a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug combination is commonly called [[Coamoxiclav|co-amoxiclav]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amoxicillin Susceptibility and Resistance Data|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/AmoxicillinClavulanate%20augmentin.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spectrum of activity ===

It is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, [[β-lactam antibiotic]] in the [[aminopenicillin]] family used to treat susceptible [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better-absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics. 
In general, ''[[Streptococcus]], [[Bacillus subtilis]], [[Enterococcus]], [[Haemophilus]], [[Helicobacter]],'' and ''[[Moraxella]]'' are susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas ''[[Citrobacter]], [[Klebsiella]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' are resistant to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amoxicillin spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and Resistance|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Amoxicillin%20sodium%20salt.pdf |accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and most clinical strains of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees.

==Adverse effects==

[[Adverse drug reaction|Adverse effect]]s are similar to those for other [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s, including [[nausea]], vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated [[colitis]]. Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) may also occur. Rarer adverse effects include mental changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these adverse effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in fingertips and around groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously.  However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased.  For some people allergic to amoxicillin, the adverse effects can be fatal due to [[anaphylaxis]].

Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused mild [[hepatitis]] in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested [[lethargy]], vomiting, and [[Renal failure|renal dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-induced hepatitis | journal = Am.

Baselt | title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man | edition = 8th | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Foster City, CA | year = 2008 | pages = 81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is poor reporting of adverse effects of amoxicillin from clinical trials. For this reason, the severity and frequency of adverse effects from amoxicillin is probably higher than reported from clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gillies M, Ranakusuma A, Hoffmann T, Thorning S, McGuire T, Glasziou P, Del Mar C |title=Common harms from amoxicillin: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials for any indication |journal=CMAJ |volume=187 |issue=1 |pages=E21–31 |date=January 2015 |pmid=25404399 |pmc=4284189 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.140848 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonallergic rash===
Between 3 and 10% of children taking amoxicillin (or [[ampicillin]]) show a late-developing (&gt;72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously) rash, which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;amoxicillin rash&quot;. The rash can also occur in adults.

The rash is described as [[maculopapular]] or morbilliform ([[Measles|measles-like]]; therefore, in medical literature, it is called &quot;amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2654598 |title=Role of delayed cellular hypersensitivity and adhesion molecules in amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rashes |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |accessdate=2010-11-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229151904/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2654598 |archivedate=2011-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pichichero ME |title=A review of evidence supporting the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for prescribing cephalosporin antibiotics for penicillin-allergic patients |journal=Pediatrics |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=1048–57 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15805383 |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1276 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/4/1048 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218212827/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/4/1048 |archivedate=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schmitt, Barton D. |title=Your child's health: the parents' one-stop reference guide to symptoms, emergencies, common illnesses, behavior problems, healthy development |edition=2nd |publisher=Bantam Books |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=978-0-553-38369-0 |oclc= |doi= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/yourchildshealth00bart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of [[infectious mononucleosis]]. Some studies indicate about 80-90% of patients with acute [[Epstein Barr virus]] infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kagan | first=B | title=Ampicillin rash |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=333–335 |year=1977 | pmid=855325 | pmc=1237570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Amoxicillin (α-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin) is a semisynthetic derivative of penicillin with a structure similar to ampicillin but with better absorption when taken by mouth, thus yielding higher concentrations in blood and in urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Handsfield HH, Clark H, Wallace JF, Holmes KK, Turck M |title=Amoxicillin, a new penicillin antibiotic |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=262–5 |date=February 1973 |pmid=4208282 |pmc=444397 |doi= 10.1128/AAC.3.2.262|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amoxicillin diffuses easily into tissues and body fluids. Penetration into the central nervous system increases in meningitis. It will cross the placenta and is excreted into breastmilk in small quantities. It is excreted into the urine and metabolized by the liver. It has an onset of 30 minutes and a half-life of 3.7 hours in newborns and 1.4 hours in adults.&lt;ref name = Davisamox/&gt;

Amoxicillin attaches to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It also is a bactericidal compound. It is effective against streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Escherichia coli'', ''Proteus mirabilis'', ''Neisseria meningitidis'', ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'', ''Shigella'', ''Chlamydia trachomatis'', ''Salmonella'', ''Borrelia burgdorferi'', and ''Helicobacter pylori''.&lt;ref name = Davisamox/&gt; As a derivative of [[ampicillin]], amoxicillin is a member of the [[penicillin]] family and, like penicillins, is a [[β-lactam antibiotic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcamo2003&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Alcamo |first=I.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of antibiotics}}
Amoxicillin was one of several [[semisynthesis|semisynthetic]] derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid ([[6-APA]]) developed at [[Beecham Group|Beecham, England]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=GB |number=978178 |status=patent |title=Penicillins |pubdate=1964-12-16 |fdate=1962-11-02 |pridate=1962-11-02 |invent1=John Herbert Charles Nayler |invent2=Harry Smith |assign1=Beecham Research Laboratories Ltd |url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=GB&amp;NR=978178A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=&amp;date=19641216&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=GB |number=1241844 |status=patent |title=Penicillins |pubdate=1971-08-04 |fdate=1968-08-23 |pridate=1968-08-23 |invent1=Anthony Alfred Walter Long |invent2=John Herber Charles Nayler |assign1=Beecham Group LTD |url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=GB&amp;NR=1241844&amp;KC=&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became available in 1972 and was the second [[aminopenicillin]] to reach the market (after [[ampicillin]] in 1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geddes | first1 = AM | display-authors = etal   | date = Dec 2007 | title = Introduction: historical perspective and development of amoxicillin/clavulanate | url = | journal = Int J Antimicrob Agents | volume = 30 | issue = Suppl 2| pages = S109–12 | pmid = 17900874 | doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravina&gt;{{cite book |last=Raviña |first=E |title=The Evolution of Drug Discovery |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2014 |page=262 |isbn=9783527326693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruggink |first=A |title=Synthesis of β-lactam antibiotics |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7923-7060-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coamoxiclav|Co-amoxiclav]] became available in 1981.&lt;ref name=Ravina/&gt;

{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=Soft matter}}

In [[condensed matter physics]] and [[materials science]], an '''amorphous''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''a'', without, ''morphé'', shape, form) or '''non-crystalline solid''' is a [[solid]] that lacks the [[long-range order]] that is characteristic of a [[crystal]]. In some older books, the term has been used synonymously with [[glass]]. Nowadays, &quot;glassy solid&quot; or &quot;amorphous solid&quot; is considered to be the overarching concept, and glass the more special case: Glass is an amorphous solid that exhibits a [[glass transition]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Zarzycki: Les verres et l'état vitreux. Paris: Masson 1982. English translation available.&lt;/ref&gt; Polymers are often amorphous. Other types of amorphous solids include [[gel]]s, [[thin film]]s, and nanostructured materials such as glass.

Amorphous materials have an internal structure made of interconnected structural blocks.

In the pharmaceutical industry, the amorphous drugs were shown to have higher bio-availability than their crystalline counterparts due to the high solubility of amorphous phase. Moreover, certain compounds can undergo precipitation in their amorphous form ''[[In vivo supersaturation|in vivo]]'', and they can decrease each other's bio-availability if administered together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsieh|first=Yi-Ling|last2=Ilevbare|first2=Grace A.|last3=Van Eerdenbrugh|first3=Bernard|last4=Box|first4=Karl J.|last5=Sanchez-Felix|first5=Manuel Vincente|last6=Taylor|first6=Lynne S.|date=2012-05-12|title=pH-Induced Precipitation Behavior of Weakly Basic Compounds: Determination of Extent and Duration of Supersaturation Using Potentiometric Titration and Correlation to Solid State Properties|journal=Pharmaceutical Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=10|pages=2738–2753|doi=10.1007/s11095-012-0759-8|pmid=22580905|issn=0724-8741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dengale|first=Swapnil Jayant|last2=Grohganz|first2=Holger|last3=Rades|first3=Thomas|last4=Löbmann|first4=Korbinian|date=May 2016|title=Recent advances in co-amorphous drug formulations|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|volume=100|pages=116–125|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.009|pmid=26805787|issn=0169-409X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nano-structured materials==
Even amorphous materials have some shortrange order at the atomic length scale due to the nature of [[chemical bond]]ing (see [[structure of liquids and glasses]] for more information on non-crystalline material structure). Furthermore, in very small [[crystal]]s a large fraction of the [[atom]]s are the crystal; relaxation of the surface and interfacial effects distort the atomic positions, decreasing the structural order. Even the most advanced structural characterization techniques, such as x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, have difficulty in distinguishing between amorphous and crystalline structures on these length scales.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Amorphous thin films ==
{{Context|section|date=January 2014}}
Amorphous phases are important constituents of [[thin film]]s, which are solid layers of a few [[nanometre]]s to some tens of [[micrometre]]s thickness deposited upon a substrate. So-called structure zone models were developed to describe the micro structure and ceramics of thin films as a function of the [[homologous temperature]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is the ratio of deposition temperature over melting temperature.&lt;ref name=MoDe1969&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = B. A.|last1 = Movchan|first2 = A. V.|last2 = Demchishin|title= Study of the structure and properties of thick vacuum condensates of nickel, titanium, tungsten, aluminium oxide and zirconium dioxide|journal = [[Phys. Met.

Vac. Sci. Technol.]]|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 666–670|year = 1974|doi = 10.1116/1.1312732|bibcode = 1974JVST...11..666T}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these models, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the occurrence of amorphous phases is that ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' has to be smaller than 0.3, that is the deposition temperature must be below 30% of the melting temperature. For higher values, the surface diffusion of deposited atomic species would allow for the formation of crystallites with long range atomic order.

Regarding their applications, amorphous metallic layers played an important role in the discussion of a suspected [[superconductivity]] in [[amorphous metal]]s.&lt;ref name=Buck1961&gt;{{cite conference|last=Buckel|first=W.|title=The influence of crystal bonds on film growth|booktitle=Elektrische en Magnetische Eigenschappen van dunne Metallaagies|place=Leuven, Belgium|date=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[optical coating]]s made from [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Tantalum pentoxide|Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] etc. and combinations of them in most cases consist of amorphous phases of these compounds. Much research is carried out into thin amorphous films as a gas separating [[Biological membrane|membrane]] layer.&lt;ref name=Vos1998&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Renate M.|last1 = de Vos|first2 = Henk|last2 = Verweij|title = High-Selectivity, High-Flux Silica Membranes for Gas Separation|journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume = 279|issue = 5357|pages = 1710–1711|year = 1998|pmid = 9497287|doi = 10.1126/science.279.5357.1710|bibcode = 1998Sci...279.1710D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technologically most important thin amorphous film is probably represented by few nm thin SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers serving as isolator above the conducting channel of a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor ([[MOSFET]]). Also, hydrogenated [[amorphous silicon]], a-Si:H in short, is of technical significance for [[thin-film solar cells]]. In case of a-Si:H the missing long-range order between silicon atoms is partly induced by the presence by hydrogen in the percent range.

The occurrence of amorphous phases turned out as a phenomenon of particular interest for studying thin-film growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Electronic structure and chemical bonding of amorphous chromium carbide thin films|first1 = Martin|last1 = Magnuson|first2 = Matilda|last2 = Andersson|first3 = Jun|last3 = Lu|first4 = Lars|last4 = Hultman|first5 = Ulf|last5 = Jansson|year = 2012|journal = [[J.

The most investigated example is represented by thin multicrystalline silicon films, where such as the unoriented molecule. An initial amorphous layer was observed in many studies.&lt;ref name=Birk2001&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = M.|last1 = Birkholz|first2 = B.|last2 = Selle|first3 = W.|last3 = Fuhs|first4 = S.|last4 = Christiansen|first5 = H.

'''''A Wizard of Earthsea''''' is a [[fantasy]] novel written by American author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] and first published by the [[small press]] Parnassus in 1968. It is regarded as a classic of children's literature, and of fantasy, within which it was widely influential. The story is set in the fictional [[archipelago]] of [[Earthsea (universe)|Earthsea]] and centers around a young [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]] named [[Ged (Earthsea)|Ged]], born in a village on the island of Gont. He displays great power while still a boy and joins the school of wizardry, where his prickly nature drives him into conflict with one of his fellows. During a magical duel, Ged's spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature that attacks him. The novel follows his journey as he seeks to be free of the creature.

The book has often been described as a ''[[Bildungsroman]],'' or coming-of-age story, as it explores Ged's process of learning to cope with power and come to terms with death. The novel also carries [[Taoism|Taoist]] themes about a fundamental balance in the universe of Earthsea, which wizards are supposed to maintain, closely tied to the idea that language and names have power to affect the material world and alter this balance. The structure of the story is similar to that of a [[Epic poetry|traditional epic]], although critics have also described it as subverting this genre in many ways, such as by making the protagonist [[Person of color|dark-skinned]] in contrast to more typical [[White people|white-skinned]] heroes.

''A Wizard of Earthsea'' received highly positive reviews, initially as a work for children and later among a general audience as well. It won the [[Boston Globe–Horn Book Award]] in 1969 and was one of the final recipients of the [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] in 1979. [[Margaret Atwood]] called it one of the &quot;wellsprings&quot; of fantasy literature.{{sfn|Russell|2014}} Le Guin wrote five subsequent books that are collectively referred to as the ''[[Earthsea|Earthsea Cycle]]'', together with ''A Wizard of Earthsea'': ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]'' (1971), ''[[The Farthest Shore]]'' (1972), ''[[Tehanu]]'' (1990), ''[[The Other Wind]]'' (2001), and ''[[Tales from Earthsea]]'' (2001). [[George Slusser]] described the series as a &quot;work of high style and imagination&quot;,{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–35}} while [[Amanda Craig]] said that ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' was &quot;the most thrilling, wise, and beautiful children's novel ever&quot;.{{sfn|Craig|2003}}

== Background ==
[[File:Ursula K Le Guin.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Refer to caption|Le Guin giving a reading in 2008]]

Early concepts for the Earthsea setting were developed in two short stories, &quot;[[The Rule of Names]]&quot; (1964) and &quot;[[The Word of Unbinding]]&quot; (1964), both published in ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80–81}} The stories were later collected in Le Guin's anthology ''[[The Wind's Twelve Quarters]]'' (1975).{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=96}} Earthsea was also used as the setting for a story Le Guin wrote in 1965 or 1966, which was never published.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=25}} In 1967, Herman Schein (the publisher of Parnassus Press and the husband of [[Ruth Robbins]], the illustrator of the book){{sfn|Schein|1962}} asked Le Guin to try writing a book &quot;for older kids&quot;, giving her complete freedom over the subject and the approach.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=xi}} Le Guin had no previous experience specifically with the genre of young adult literature, which rose in prominence during the late 1960s.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=9–11}} Drawing from her short stories, Le Guin began work on ''A Wizard of Earthsea''. Le Guin has said that the book was in part a response to the image of wizards as ancient and wise, and to her wondering where they come from.{{sfn|Le Guin|Wood|1980|p=41}} Le Guin later said that she chose the medium of fantasy, and the theme of coming of age, with her intended adolescent audience in mind.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=22}}

The short stories published in 1964 introduced the world of [[Earthsea]] and important concepts in it, such as Le Guin's [[Earthsea (universe)#Magic in Earthsea|treatment of magic]]. &quot;The Rule of Names&quot; also introduced Yevaud, a dragon who features briefly in ''A Wizard of Earthsea''.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}} Le Guin's depiction of Earthsea was influenced by her familiarity with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] legends as well as [[Norse mythology]].{{sfn|Griffin|1996}}{{sfn|Spivack|1984a|p=2}} Her knowledge of myths and legends, as well as her familial interest in [[anthropology]], have been described by scholar Donna White as allowing her to create &quot;entire cultures&quot; for the islands of Earthsea.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=9–11}} The influence of Norse lore in particular can be seen in the characters of the Kargs, who are blonde and blue-eyed, and worship two gods who are brothers.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} The influence of [[Taoism|Taoist thought]] on Le Guin's writing is also visible in the idea of a cosmic &quot;balance&quot; in the universe of Earthsea.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}}

Earthsea itself is an [[archipelago]] or group of islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=8}} The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody in each of the original trilogy of novels.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=9–10}} The setting of Earthsea is [[Pre-industrial society|preindustrial]], and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}} Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned [[Karg]]ish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}}

=== Plot summary ===
The novel follows a young boy called [[Ged (Earthsea)|Duny]], nicknamed &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot;, born on the island of Gont. Discovering that the boy has great innate power, his aunt teaches him the little magic she knows.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}} When his village is attacked by Kargish raiders, Duny summons a fog to conceal the village and its inhabitants, enabling the residents to drive off the Kargs.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} Hearing of this, the powerful mage [[Aihal|Ogion]] takes him as an apprentice, giving him his &quot;true name&quot;—Ged.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}} Ogion tries to teach Ged about the &quot;equilibrium&quot;, the concept that magic can upset the natural order of the world if used improperly. In an attempt to impress a girl, however, Ged searches Ogion's spell books and inadvertently summons a strange shadow, which has to be banished by Ogion. Sensing Ged's eagerness to act and impatience with his slow teaching methods, Ogion sends him to the renowned school for wizards on the island of Roke.

At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration even among the teachers. He is befriended by an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel of magic.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} Ged casts a powerful spell intended to raise the spirit of a legendary dead woman, but the spell goes awry and instead releases a shadow creature, which attacks him and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle drives the shadow away, but at the cost of his life.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}}

Ged spends many months healing before resuming his studies. The new Archmage, Gensher, describes the shadow as an ancient evil that wishes to [[demonic possession|possess]] Ged, and warns him that the creature has no name. Ged eventually receives his wizard's staff,{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} and takes up residence in the Ninety Isles, providing the poor villagers protection from the dragons that have seized and taken up residence on the nearby island of Pendor, but discovers that he is still being sought by the shadow. Knowing that he cannot guard against both threats at the same time, he sails to Pendor and gambles his life on a guess of the adult dragon's true name. When he is proved right, the dragon offers to tell him the name of the shadow, but Ged instead extracts a promise that the dragon and his offspring will never threaten the archipelago.

Chased by the shadow, Ged flees to Osskil, having heard of the stone of the Terrenon. He is attacked by the shadow, and barely escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, the lady of the castle, shows him the stone, and urges Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Recognizing that the stone harbors one of the Old Powers—ancient, powerful, malevolent beings—Ged refuses. He flees and is pursued by the stone's minions, but [[Shapeshifting|transforms]] into a swift falcon and escapes.

Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont. Unlike Gensher, Ogion insists that all creatures have a name and advises Ged to confront the shadow.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} Ogion is proved right; when Ged seeks out the shadow, it flees from him. Ged pursues it in a small sailboat, until it lures him into a fog where the boat is wrecked on a [[reef]]. Ged recovers with the help of an elderly couple marooned on a small island since they were children; the woman gives Ged part of a broken bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and resumes his pursuit of the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish, he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}} They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Naming it with his own name, Ged merges with it and joyfully tells Vetch he is healed and whole.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|pp=98–99}}

The first edition of the book, published in 1968, was illustrated by [[Ruth Robbins]]. The cover illustration was in color, and the interior of the book contained a map of the archipelago of Earthsea. In addition, each chapter had a black-and-white illustration by Robbins, similar to a [[woodcut]] image. The images represented topics from each chapter; for instance, the very first image depicted the island of Gont, while the illustration for the chapter &quot;The Dragon of Pendor&quot; pictured a flying dragon. The image shown here depicts Ged sailing in his boat ''Lookfar'', and was used in the 10th chapter, &quot;The Open Sea&quot;, in which Ged and Vetch travel from Iffish eastward past all known lands to confront the shadow creature.

===Publication===
''A Wizard of Earthsea'' was first published in 1968 by [[Parnassus Press]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]],{{sfn|Slusser|1976|p=59}} a year before ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', Le Guin's watershed work.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–33}} It was a personal landmark for Le Guin, as it represented her first attempt at writing for children; she had written only a handful of other novels and short stories prior to its publication.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} The book was also her first attempt at writing [[fantasy]], rather than science-fiction.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=xi}}{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' was the first of Le Guin's books to receive widespread critical attention,{{sfn|White|1999|p=5}} and has been described as her best known work, as part of the Earthsea series.{{sfn|Clute|Grant|1997|p=573}} The book has been released in numerous editions, including an illustrated [[Folio Society]] edition released in 2015.{{sfn|Mitchell|2015}} It was also translated into a number of other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Wizard of Earthsea|website=buffalolib.org|url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/906657/Reviews|publisher=Buffalo and Erie county public Library|accessdate=September 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920164152/https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/906657/Reviews|archive-date=September 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; An omnibus edition of all of Le Guin's Earthsea works was released on the 50th anniversary of the publication of ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' in 2018.{{sfn|Flood|2015}}

Le Guin originally intended for ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' to be a standalone novel, but decided to write a sequel after considering the loose ends in the first book, and ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]'' was released in 1971. ''[[The Farthest Shore]]'' was written as a third volume after further consideration, and was published in 1972.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=9, 24}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=95}} ''The Tombs of Atuan'' tells of the story of Ged's attempt to make whole the ring of Erreth Akbe, half of which is buried in the tombs of Atuan in the Kargish lands, from where he must steal it. There, he meets the child priestess Tenar, on whom the book focuses.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=95}} In ''The Farthest Shore'', Ged, who has become Archmage, tries to combat a dwindling of magic across Earthsea, accompanied by Arren, a young prince.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80–81}} The first three books are together seen as the &quot;original trilogy&quot;;{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=9}} in each of these, Ged is shown as trying to heal some imbalance in the world.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=95}} They were followed by ''[[Tehanu]]'' (1990), ''[[Tales from Earthsea]]'' (2001), and ''[[The Other Wind]]'' (2001), which are sometimes referred to as the &quot;second trilogy&quot;.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=6, 7, 89, 96}}

== Reception ==

===As children's literature===
Initial recognition for the book was from children's-book critics, among whom it garnered acclaim.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=81}} ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy.{{sfn|White|1999|p=11}} In her 1975 annotated collection ''Fantasy for Children'', British critic [[Naomi Lewis]] described it in the following terms: &quot;[It is not] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves in one of the most important works of fantasy of our time.&quot;{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that &quot;Le Guin has&amp;nbsp;... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy&quot;,{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} while a review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by author and journalist [[Amanda Craig]] said it was &quot;The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [written] in prose as taut and clean as a ship's sail.&quot;{{sfn|Craig|2003}}

In discussing the book for a gathering of children's librarians [[Eleanor Cameron]] praised the world building in the story, saying &quot;it is as if [Le Guin] herself has lived on the archipelago.&quot;{{sfn|White|1999|p=12}} Author David Mitchell called the titular character Ged a &quot;superb creation&quot;, and argued that he was a more relatable wizard than those featured in prominent works of fantasy at the time. According to him, characters such as [[Gandalf]] were &quot;variants on the archetype of Merlin, a Caucasian scholarly aristocrat amongst sorcerers&quot; with little room to grow, whereas Ged developed as a character through his story.{{sfn|Mitchell|2015}} Mitchell also praised the other characters in the story, who he said seemed to have a &quot;fully thought-out inner life&quot; despite being fleeting presences.{{sfn|Mitchell|2015}} The 1995 ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' said that the Earthsea books had been considered the finest science fiction books for children in the post-World War II period.{{sfn|Nicholls|1995a}}

===As fantasy===
Commentators have noted that the Earthsea novels in general received less critical attention because they were considered children's books. Le Guin herself took exception to this treatment of [[children's literature]], describing it as &quot;adult chauvinist piggery&quot;.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} In 1976, literary scholar George Slusser criticized the &quot;silly publication classification designating the original series as 'children's literature'&quot;.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=96}} Barbara Bucknall stated that &quot;Le Guin was not writing for young children when she wrote these fantasies, nor yet for adults. She was writing for 'older kids.' But in fact she can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. These stories are ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age.&quot;{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=96}} Only in later years did ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' receive attention from a more general audience.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} Literary scholar T. A. Shippey was among the first to treat ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' as serious literature, assuming in his analysis of the volume that it belonged alongside works by [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], among others.{{sfn|White|1999|p=23}} Margaret Atwood said that she saw the book as &quot;a fantasy book for adults&quot;,{{sfn|Russell|2014}} and added that the book could be categorized as either young adult fiction or as fantasy, but since it dealt with themes such as &quot;life and mortality and who are we as human beings&quot;, it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve.{{sfn|Russell|2014}} The ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' echoed this view, saying the series's appeal went &quot;far beyond&quot; the young adults for whom it was written.{{sfn|Nicholls|1995a}} It went on to praise the book as &quot;austere but vivid&quot;, and said the series was more thoughtful than the ''[[Narnia]]'' books by C. S. Lewis.{{sfn|Nicholls|1995b}}

In his 1980 history of fantasy, [[Brian Attebery]] called the Earthsea trilogy &quot;the most challenging and richest American fantasy to date&quot;.{{sfn|White|1999|p=37}} Slusser described the Earthsea cycle as a &quot;work of high style and imagination&quot;,{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–35}} and the original trilogy of books a product of &quot;genuine epic vision&quot;.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=86}} In 1974, critic [[Robert Scholes]] compared Le Guin's work favorably to that of [[C. S. Lewis]], saying, &quot;Where C. S. Lewis worked out a specifically Christian set of values, Ursula LeGuin works not with a theology but with an ecology, a cosmology, a reverence for the universe as a self-regulating structure.&quot;{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} He added that Le Guin's three Earthsea novels were themselves a sufficient legacy for anybody to leave.{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}} In 2014 David Pringle called it &quot;a beautiful story—poetic, thrilling, and profound&quot;.{{sfn|Pringle|2014|loc=chpt. 39}}

===Accolades===
''A Wizard of Earthsea'' won or contributed to several notable awards for Le Guin. It won the [[Boston Globe–Horn Book Award]] in 1969,{{sfn|Esmonde|1981}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Horn Book|title=Boston Globe–Horn Book Awards – List of past winners |url=http://archive.hbook.com/bghb/past/past.asp |accessdate=November 10, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019092012/http://archive.hbook.com/bghb/past/past.asp |archivedate=October 19, 2011 |url-status = dead|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the last winners of the [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] ten years later.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=5}} In 1984 it won the {{Interlanguage link|Złota Sepulka|pl}} or the &quot;Golden Sepulka&quot; in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/award/show/6733-z-ota-sepulka|title=Zlota Sepulka Winners|website=goodreads.com|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfif.republika.pl/awards/Zlota_Sepulka_win.html|title=Gold Sepulka |website=sfif.republika|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}{{deadlink|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Le Guin was given the [[Margaret A.

The award cited six of her works, including the first four Earthsea volumes, ''The Left Hand of Darkness'', and ''[[The Beginning Place]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ursula K.

===Influence===
The book has been seen as widely influential within the genre of fantasy. [[Margaret Atwood]] has called ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' one of the &quot;wellsprings&quot; of fantasy literature.{{sfn|Russell|2014}} The book has been compared to major works of [[high fantasy]] such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''{{sfn|Craig|2003}}{{sfn|Kuznets|1985}} and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. The notion that names can exert power is also present in [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s 2001 film ''[[Spirited Away]]''; critics have suggested that that idea originated with Le Guin's Earthsea series.{{sfn|Reider|2005}} Novelist [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]], author of books such as ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'', described ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' as having a strong influence on him, and said that he felt a desire to &quot;wield words with the same power as Ursula Le Guin&quot;.{{sfn|Kerridge|2015}}

Modern writers have credited ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' for introducing the idea of a &quot;wizard school&quot;, which would later be made famous by the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of books,{{sfn|Craig|2003}} and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard, also present in ''Harry Potter''.{{sfn|Power|2016}} Reviewers have also commented that the basic premise of ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', that of a talented boy going to a wizard's school and making an enemy with whom he has a close connection, is also the premise of ''Harry Potter''.{{sfn|Power|2016}} Ged also receives a scar from the shadow, which hurts whenever the shadow is near him, just as Harry Potter's scar from [[Voldemort]]. Commenting on the similarity, Le Guin said that she did not feel that [[J. K. Rowling]] &quot;ripped her off&quot;, but that Rowling's books received too much praise for supposed originality, and that Rowling &quot;could have been more gracious about her predecessors. My incredulity was at the critics who found the first book wonderfully original. She has many virtues, but originality isn't one of them. That hurt.&quot;{{sfn|Jaggi|2005}}

== Themes ==

===Coming of age===
''A Wizard of Earthsea'' focuses on Ged's adolescence and coming of age,{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=80}} and along with the other two works of the original Earthsea trilogy forms a part of Le Guin's dynamic portrayal of the process of growing old.{{sfn|Spivack|1984b}} The three novels together follow Ged from youth to old age, and each of them also follow the coming of age of a different character.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=9}} The novel is frequently described as a ''[[Bildungsroman]]''.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=91}} Scholar Mike Cadden stated that the book is a convincing tale &quot;to a reader as young and possibly as headstrong as Ged, and therefore sympathetic to him&quot;.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=91}} Ged's coming of age is also intertwined with the physical journey he undertakes through the novel.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=99}}

Ged is depicted as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=92–93}} Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually realize that there is a price to be paid for his actions,{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=92–93}} as he learns to discipline his magical powers.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=30}} Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=31–32}}

The passage at the end of the novel, wherein Ged finally accepts the shadow as a part of himself and is thus released from its terror, has been pointed to by reviewers as a [[rite of passage]]. Jeanne Walker, for example, wrote that the rite of passage at the end was an analogue for the entire plot of ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', and that the plot itself plays the role of a rite of passage for an adolescent reader.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=99–100}}{{sfn|White|1999|pp=34–35}} Walker goes on to say, &quot;The entire action of A Wizard of Earthsea&amp;nbsp;... portrays the hero's slow realization of what it means to be an individual in society and a self in relation to higher powers.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=99–100}} Many readers and critics have commented on similarities between Ged's process of growing up and ideas in [[Self in Jungian psychology|Jungian psychology]]. The young Ged has a scary encounter with a [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow creature]], which he later realizes is the dark side of himself. It is only after he recognizes and merges with the shadow that he becomes a whole person.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=100}} Le Guin said that she had never read [[Carl Jung|Jung]] before writing the Earthsea novels.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|White|1999|p=17}}

Le Guin described coming of age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that &quot;Coming of age&amp;nbsp;... is a process that took me many years; I finished it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact.&quot;{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=22}} She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing coming of age, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of &quot;rational daily life&quot;.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=22}} The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=24}} Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=99}}

===Equilibrium and Taoist themes===
The world of Earthsea is depicted as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody in each of the original trilogy of novels. This includes an equilibrium between land and sea (implicit in the name Earthsea), and between people and their natural environment.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=9–10}} In addition to physical equilibrium, there is a larger cosmic equilibrium, which everybody is aware of, and which wizards are tasked with maintaining.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=25–26}} Describing this aspect of Earthsea, Elizabeth Cummins wrote, &quot;The principle of balanced powers, the recognition that every act affects self, society, world, and cosmos, is both a physical and a moral principle of Le Guin's fantasy world.&quot;{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=26}} The concept of balance is related to the novel's other major theme of coming of age, as Ged's knowledge of the consequences of his own actions for good or ill is necessary for him to understand how the balance is maintained.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|pp=28–29}} While at the school of Roke, the Master Hand tells him: {{quote|But you must not change one thing, one pebble, one grain of sand, until you know what good and evil will follow on that act. The world is in balance, in Equilibrium. A wizard's power of Changing and of Summoning can shake the balance of the world. It is dangerous, that power. It is most perilous. It must follow knowledge, and serve need. To light a candle is to cast a shadow.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}}{{sfn|Le Guin|2012|p=51}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=32}}}}

The influence of Taoism on Le Guin's writing is evident through much of the book, especially in her depiction of the &quot;balance&quot;. At the end of the novel, Ged, may be seen to embody the Taoist way of life, as he has learned not to act unless absolutely necessary.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} He has also learned that seeming opposites, like light and dark or good and evil, are actually interdependent.{{sfn|Griffin|1996}} Light and dark themselves are recurring images within the story.{{sfn|White|1999|p=37}} Reviewers have identified this belief as evidence of a conservative ideology within the story, shared with much of fantasy. In emphasizing concerns over balance and equilibrium, scholars have argued, Le Guin essentially justifies the status quo, which wizards strive to maintain.{{sfn|White|1999|p=36}} This tendency is in contrast to Le Guin's science fiction writing, in which change is shown to have value.{{sfn|White|1999|p=36}}

The nature of human evil forms a significant related theme through ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' as well as the other Earthsea novels.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–35}} As with other works by Le Guin, evil is shown as a misunderstanding of the balance of life. Ged is born with great power in him, but the pride that he takes in his power leads to his downfall; he tries to demonstrate his strength by bringing a spirit back from the dead, and in performing this act against the laws of nature, releases the shadow that attacks him.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–36}} Slusser suggests that although he is provoked into performing dangerous spells first by the girl on Gont and then by Jasper, this provocation exists in Ged's mind. He is shown as unwilling to look within himself and see the pride that drives him to do what he does.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–36}} When he accepts the shadow into himself, he also finally accepts responsibility for his own actions,{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–36}} and by accepting his own mortality he is able to free himself.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|p=37}} His companion Vetch describes the moment by saying {{quote|that Ged had neither lost nor won but, naming the shadow of his death with his own name, had made himself whole: a man: who, knowing his whole true self, cannot be used or possessed by any power other than himself, and whose life therefore is lived for life's sake and never in the service of ruin, or pain, or hatred, or the dark.{{sfn|Le Guin|2012|p=214}}{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=37}}}}

Thus, although there are several dark powers in Earthsea (like the dragon, and the stone of Terrenon) the true evil was not one of these powers, or even death, but Ged's actions that went against the balance of nature.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=37–38}} This is contrary to conventional Western and Christian storytelling, in which light and darkness are often considered opposites, and are seen as symbolizing good and evil, which are constantly in conflict.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=34}}{{sfn|White|1999|p=18}} On two different occasions, Ged is tempted to try to defy death and evil, but eventually learns that neither can be eliminated: instead, he chooses not to serve evil, and stops denying death.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=36}}

===True names===
In Le Guin's fictional universe, to know the [[true name]] of an object or a person is to have power over it.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=96}}{{sfn|Slusser|1976|p=37}} Each child is given a true name when they reach puberty, a name which they share only with close friends.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=27}} Several of the dragons in the later Earthsea novels, like Orm Embar and Kalessin, are shown as living openly with their names, which do not give anybody power over them.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=96}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=108–109}} In ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', however, Ged is shown to have power over Yevaud. Cadden writes that this is because Yevaud still has attachment to riches and material possessions, and is thus bound by the power of his name.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=108–109}} Wizards exert their influence over the equilibrium through the use of names, thus linking this theme to Le Guin's depiction of a cosmic balance. According to Cummins, this is Le Guin's way of demonstrating the power of language in shaping reality. Since language is the tool we use for communicating about the environment, she argues that it also allows humans to affect the environment, and the wizards' power to use names symbolizes this.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=11}} Cummins went on to draw an analogy between the a wizard's use of names to change things with the creative use of words in fictional writing.{{sfn|Cummins|1990|p=27}} Shippey wrote that Earthsea magic seems to work through what he called the &quot;Rumpelstiltskin theory&quot;, in which names have power. He argued that this portrayal was part of Le Guin's effort to emphasize the power of words over objects, which, according to Shippey, was in contrast to the ideology of other fantasy writers, such as [[James Frazer]] in ''[[The Golden Bough]]''.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=21–22}} Esmonde argued that each of the first three Earthsea books hinged on an act of trust. In ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', Vetch trusts Ged with his true name when the latter is at his lowest ebb emotionally, thus giving Ged complete power over him. Ged later offers Tenar the same gift in ''The Tombs of Atuan'', thereby allowing her to learn trust.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=28–29}}

== Style and structure ==
===Language and mood===
''A Wizard of Earthsea'' and other novels of the Earthsea cycle differ notably from Le Guin's early [[Hainish cycle]] works, although they were written at a similar time.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–35}} George Slusser described the Earthsea works as providing a counterweight to the &quot;excessive pessimism&quot; of the Hainish novels.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–35}} He saw the former as depicting individual action in a favorable light, in contrast to works such as &quot;[[Vaster than Empires and More Slow]]&quot;.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–35}} The ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' said the book was pervaded by a &quot;grave joyfulness&quot;.{{sfn|Nicholls|1995b}} In discussing the style of her fantasy works, Le Guin herself said that in fantasy it was necessary to be clear and direct with language, because there is no known framework for the reader's mind to rest upon.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=32–35}}

The story often appears to assume that readers are familiar with the geography and history of Earthsea, a technique which allowed Le Guin to avoid [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]]:{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86–88}} a reviewer wrote that this method &quot;gives Le Guin's world the mysterious depths of Tolkien's, but without his tiresome back-stories and versifying&quot;.{{sfn|Craig|2003}} In keeping with the notion of an epic, the narration switches from looking ahead into Ged's future and looking back into the past of Earthsea.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86–88}} At the same time, Slusser described the mood of the novel as &quot;strange and dreamlike&quot;, fluctuating between objective reality and the thoughts in Ged's mind; some of Ged's adversaries are real, while others are phantoms.{{sfn|Slusser|1976|pp=35–38}} This narrative technique, which Cadden characterizes as &quot;free indirect discourse&quot; makes the narrator of the book seem sympathetic to the protagonist, and does not distance his thoughts from the reader.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=91–93}}

===Myth and epic===
''A Wizard of Earthsea'' has strong elements of an [[epic (genre)|epic]]; for instance, Ged's place in Earthsea history is described at the very beginning of the book in the following terms: &quot;some say the greatest, and surely the greatest voyager, was the man called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage.&quot;{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86–88}} The story also begins with words from the Earthsea song &quot;The Creation of Éa&quot;, which forms a ritualistic beginning to the book.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86–88}} The teller of the story then goes on to say that it is from Ged's youth, thereby establishing context for the rest of the book.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|pp=86–88}} In comparison with the protagonists of many of Le Guin's other works, Ged is superficially a typical hero, a mage who sets out on a quest.{{sfn|Rochelle|2001|p=48}} Reviewers have compared ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' to epics such as ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{sfn|White|1999|p=24}} Scholar Virginia White argued that the story followed a structure common to epics in which the protagonist begins an adventure, faces trials along the way, and eventually returns in triumph. White went on to suggest that this structure can be seen in the series as a whole, as well as in the individual volumes.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=32–33}}

Le Guin subverted many of the tropes typical to such &quot;monomyths&quot;; the protagonists of her story were all [[Person of color|dark-skinned]], in comparison to the [[White people|white-skinned]] heroes more traditionally used; the Kargish antagonists, in contrast, were white-skinned, a switching of race roles that has been remarked upon by multiple critics.{{sfn|Kuznets|1985}}{{sfn|Rochelle|2001|pp=48, 53}}{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=92}} Critics have also cited her use of characters from multiple class backgrounds as a choice subversive to conventional Western fantasy.{{sfn|Bernardo|Murphy|2006|p=92}} At the same time, reviewers questioned Le Guin's treatment of gender in ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', and the original trilogy as a whole. Le Guin, who later became known as a [[Feminism|feminist]], chose to restrict the use of magic to men and boys in the first volume of Earthsea.{{sfn|Craig|2003}} Initial critical reactions to ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' saw Ged's gender as incidental.{{sfn|Nodelman|1995|p=182}} In contrast, ''The Tombs of Atuan'' saw Le Guin intentionally tell a female coming-of-age story, which was nonetheless described as perpetuating a male-dominated model of Earthsea.{{sfn|Butler|2012}} ''Tehanu'' (1990), published as the fourth volume of ''Earthsea'' 18 years after the third, has been described both by Le Guin and her commentators as a feminist re-imagining of the series, in which the power and status of the chief characters are reversed, and the patriarchal social structure questioned.{{sfn|Hollindale|2003}}{{sfn|Hatfield|1993|p=43}}{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=98}} Commenting in 1993, Le Guin wrote that she could not continue [Earthsea after 1972] until she had &quot;wrestled with the angels of the feminist consciousness&quot;.{{sfn|Hollindale|2003}}

Several critics have argued that by combining elements of epic, ''Bildungsroman'', and young adult fiction, Le Guin succeeded in blurring the boundaries of conventional genres.{{sfn|Cadden|2005|p=99}} In a 1975 commentary Francis Molson argued that the series should be referred to as &quot;ethical fantasy&quot;, a term which acknowledged that the story did not always follow the tropes of heroic fantasy, and the moral questions that it raised. The term did not become popular.{{sfn|White|1999|pp=25–27}} A similar argument was made by children's literature critic Cordelia Sherman in 1985; she argued that ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' and the rest of the series sought &quot;to teach children by dramatic example what it means to be a good adult&quot;.{{sfn|White|1999|p=38}}

== Adaptations ==
A condensed, illustrated version of the first chapter was printed by [[World Book]] in the third volume of ''[[Childcraft]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Childcraft: Stories and poems|year=1989|publisher=World Book, Inc.|pages=176–187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzkKAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Earthsea#search_anchor|chapter=The Boy Who Became A Wizard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple audio versions of the book have been released. BBC Radio produced a radioplay version in 1996 narrated by [[Judi Dench]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pfpcm |title=A Wizard of Earthsea |website=[[BBC]]|date=January 5, 2011|publisher=BBC Player Radio|accessdate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a six-part series adapting the Earthsea novels in 2015, broadcast on [[Radio 4 Extra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05pktp7|title=Earthsea|website=[[BBC]]|publisher=BBC Player Radio|accessdate=July 29, 2015|date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the work was produced as an unabridged recording performed by [[Rob Inglis|Robert Inglis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM3059585&amp;R=3059585 |title=A wizard of Earthsea: Inglis, Rob, Le Guin, Ursula K.|publisher=Toronto Public Library |date=2011&lt;!-- per the website this is the date TPL 'viewed' the source --&gt;|format=audiobook |isbn=978-1449881948|accessdate=February 19, 2020}}&lt;!--Suggest using {{OCLC|799120142}}--&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A wizard of Earthsea (Audiobook on Cassette, 1992) |publisher=WorldCat.org |date=August 6, 2016 |oclc = 26816513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two screen adaptations of the story have also been produced. An original mini-series titled ''[[Legend of Earthsea]]'' was broadcast in 2005 on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]. It is based very loosely on ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' and ''The Tombs of Atuan''. In an article published in ''Salon'', Le Guin expressed strong displeasure at the result. She stated that by casting a &quot;petulant white kid&quot; as Ged (who has red-brown skin in the book) the series &quot;[[Whitewashing in film|whitewashed]] Earthsea&quot;, and had ignored her choice to write the story of a non-white character, a choice she said was central to the book.{{sfn|Le Guin|2004}} This sentiment was shared by a review in ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', which said that ''Legend of Earthsea'' &quot;totally missed the point&quot; of Le Guin's novels, &quot;ripping out all the subtlety, nuance and beauty of the books and inserting boring cliches, painful stereotypes and a very unwelcome 'epic' war in their place&quot;.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=145}}

[[Studio Ghibli]] released an adaptation of the series in 2006 titled ''[[Tales from Earthsea (film)|Tales from Earthsea]]''.{{sfn|Hairston|2010|p=183}} The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing [[Hayao Miyazaki]] would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, and in particular the use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical to the message of the book.{{sfn|Le Guin|2011}} The film received generally mixed responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gedo_senki_tales_from_earthsea|title=Gedo Senki (Tales From Earthsea)|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexandar Živojinović''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (born 27 August 1953), better known by his stage name '''Alex Lifeson''', is a Canadian [[musician]], [[Singing|singer]], [[songwriter]], and [[record producer]], best known as the guitarist of the progressive rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. In 1968, Lifeson co-founded the band that would become Rush, with drummer [[John Rutsey]] and bassist and singer [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]]. Jones was replaced by [[Geddy Lee]] a month later, and Rutsey was replaced by [[Neil Peart]] in 1974, making Lifeson the only constant member. 

With Rush, Lifeson plays electric and acoustic guitars, as well as other [[string instrument]]s such as [[mandola]], [[mandolin]], and [[bouzouki]]. He also performs backing vocals in live performances, and occasionally plays keyboards and bass pedal synthesizers. Like the other members of Rush, Lifeson performs real-time on-stage triggering of [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampled]] instruments, concurrently with his guitar playing.&lt;ref name=&quot;onstagemag.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |title=Onstagemag.com |publisher=Onstagemag.com |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |archivedate=18 October 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, although Lifeson has contributed to a body of work outside the band as well. Aside from music, Lifeson is part-owner of [[The Orbit Room]], a bar and restaurant in [[Toronto]], a painter and a licensed aircraft [[Aviator|pilot]].&lt;ref name = &quot;vdtsgn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alex Lifeson Biography |url=http://www.2112.net/xanadu/ |publisher=2112.net |accessdate=20 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012161412/http://2112.net/xanadu/| archivedate= 12 October 2007 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his bandmates [[Geddy Lee]] and [[Neil Peart]], Lifeson was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] on 9 May 1996.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lifeson was born as Alexandar Zivojinovich (Aleksandar Živojinović/Александар Живојиновић in Serbian) in [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]], [[British Columbia]], to Serbian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Živojinović, and raised in Toronto, [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name = &quot;vdtsgn&quot; /&gt; His stage name of &quot;Lifeson&quot; is a semi-literal translation of the surname [[Živojinović]], which means &quot;son of life&quot; in Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;Horizon to Horizon [http://rush.robpagano.com/index.php?c=alex Rob Pagano's Rush Music Tribute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016132306/http://rush.robpagano.com/index.php?c=alex |date=16 October 2007 }} Accessed 7 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His first exposure to formal music training came in the form of the [[viola]], which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later replaced by an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jimmy Page]],&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson profile [http://www.epiphone.com/news.asp?NewsID=137 Epiphone] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151801/http://www.epiphone.com/news.asp?NewsID=137 |date=28 September 2011 }} Accessed 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Hackett]], and [[Allan Holdsworth]];&lt;ref&gt;Guitar World Staff (12 January 2012). &quot;[http://www.guitarworld.com/60-minutes-alex-lifeson-and-geddy-lee-rush?page=0,10 60 Minutes with Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee of Rush] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807072822/http://www.guitarworld.com/60-minutes-alex-lifeson-and-geddy-lee-rush?page=0,10 |date=7 August 2017 }}&quot;. ''[[Guitar Player]]''. [[New Bay Media]]. Retrieved 2012-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt; he explained in 2011 that &quot;Clapton's solos seemed a little easier and more approachable. I remember sitting at my record player and moving the needle back and forth to get the solo in '[[Spoonful]].' But there was nothing I could do with Hendrix.&quot;&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite news |title=Alex Lifeson: Rush Keeps Rollin' |last=Cohen |first=Elliot Stephen |date=September 2011 |work=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]] |pages=42–44 |accessdate=28 August 2013 |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20110900vintageguitar.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Lifeson met future Rush drummer [[John Rutsey]] in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.

Lifeson recalls what inspired him to play guitar in a 2008 interview:

{{quote|My brother-in-law played flamenco guitar. He lent his guitar to me and I grew to like it. When you're a kid, you don't want to play an accordion because it would be too boring. But your parents might want you to play one, especially if you're from a Yugoslavian family like me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inquirer with Alex Lifeson|author=Joe Lalaina
|year=2008|journal=Guitar Legends}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lifeson's first girlfriend, Charlene, gave birth to their eldest son, Justin, in October 1970, and they married in 1975. Their second son, Adrian, was born two years later. Adrian is also involved in music, and performed on two tracks from Lifeson's 1996 solo project, ''Victor''.

===Rush===
[[Image:20110527-200145 Rush Ahoy Rotterdam 1200x0800.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Lifeson during the 2010–2011 [[Time Machine Tour]], Ahoy, [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands (27 May 2011)]]
Lifeson's neighbour [[John Rutsey]] began experimenting on a rented drum kit.  In 1963, Lifeson and Rutsey formed The Projection, which eventually became Rush in August 1968 following the recruitment of original bassist and vocalist [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]]. [[Geddy Lee]], a [[High school (North America)|high school]] friend of Lifeson, assumed this role soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banasiewicz  |first=Bill |title=Rush Visions: The Official Biography |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=1990 |isbn= 0-7119-1162-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instrumentally, Lifeson is renowned for his signature riffing, electronic effects and processing, unorthodox chord structures, and the copious arsenal of equipment he has used over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson profile [http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/bios/Lifeson.shtml Dinosaur Rock God] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209005754/http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/bios/Lifeson.shtml |date=9 February 2006 }} Accessed 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson minor overview [http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=13124 Guitar Player] Accessed 16 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson Archive [http://www.rusharchives.com/rush-gear/alex-lifeson/ Alex Lifeson Archive and equipment] Accessed 16 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Rush was on hiatus for several years starting in 1997 owing to [[Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road|personal tragedies in Neil Peart's life]], and Lifeson had not picked up a guitar for at least a year following those events.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammond |first=Shawn |title=Back in the limelight: Alex Lifeson and Rush reignite after a five-year hiatus |journal=Guitar Player |volume=38 |issue=8 |date=August 2002 |publisher=New Bay Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after some work in his home studio and on various side projects, Lifeson returned to the studio with Rush to begin work on 2002's ''Vapor Trails''. ''Vapor Trails'' is the first Rush album since the 1970s to lack keyboards—as such, Lifeson used over 50 different guitars in what [[Shawn Hammond]] of ''Guitar Player'' called &quot;his most rabid and experimental playing ever.&quot; Geddy Lee was amenable to leaving keyboards off the album due in part to Lifeson's ongoing concern about their use. Lifeson's approach to the guitar tracks for the album eschewed traditional riffs and solos in favour of &quot;tonality and harmonic quality.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;

During live performances, he used foot pedals to cue various synthesizer, guitar, and backing vocal effects as he played.

===''Victor''===
While the bulk of&amp;nbsp;Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, his first major outside work was his solo project, ''[[Victor (album)|Victor]]'', released in 1996. ''Victor'' was attributed as a self-titled work (i.e. ''Victor'' is attributed as the ''artist'' as well as the ''album title''). This was done deliberately as an alternative to issuing the album explicitly under Lifeson's name. The title track is from the [[W.&amp;nbsp;H. Auden]] poem, also entitled &quot;Victor&quot;. Both son Adrian and wife Charlene also contributed to the album. A follow-up album, possibly including vocals by [[Sarah McLachlan]], was rumoured in the late 1990s, but was apparently shelved due to Atlantic Records' lack of support for the first album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eric Hansen |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/VIClyrics.htm |title=Alex Lifeson's &quot;Victor&quot; linernotes and lyrics from Power Windows |publisher=2112.net |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702083720/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/VIClyrics.htm |archivedate=2 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Side projects===
{{main article|List of songs recorded by Rush#Alex Lifeson}}
Lifeson has also contributed to a body of work outside his involvement with the band in the form of instrumental contributions to other musical outfits. He made a guest appearance on the 1985 [[Platinum Blonde (band)|Platinum Blonde]] album ''[[Alien Shores]]'' performing guitar solos on the songs &quot;Crying Over You&quot; and &quot;Holy Water&quot;. Later, in 1990, he appeared on [[Lawrence Gowan]]'s album ''[[Lost Brotherhood]]'' to play guitar. In 1995, he guested on two tracks on [[Tom Cochrane]]'s ''[[Ragged Ass Road]]'' album and then in 1996 on [[I Mother Earth]]'s &quot;Like a Girl&quot; from the ''[[Scenery and Fish]]'' album. In 1997, he appeared on the ''Merry Axemas: A Guitar Christmas'' album. Lifeson played &quot;[[The Little Drummer Boy]]&quot; which was released as track 9 on the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merry Axemas at Allmusic, overview&quot;&gt;{{allmusic | class=album | id=mw0000463676 | tab=overview | accessdate=23 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Lifeson founded the [[Big Dirty Band]], which he created for the purpose of providing original soundtrack material for ''[[Trailer Park Boys: The Movie]]''. Lifeson [[Jam session|jammed]] regularly with the Dexters ([[the Orbit Room]] house band from 1994 to 2004). Lifeson made a guest appearance on the 2007 album ''[[Fear of a Blank Planet]]'' by UK progressive rock band [[Porcupine Tree]], contributing a solo during the song &quot;[[Anesthetize]]&quot;. He also appeared on the 2008 album ''[[Tiles (band)#About &quot;Fly Paper&quot;|Fly Paper]]'' by Detroit progressive rockers [[Tiles (band)|Tiles]]. He plays on the track &quot;Sacred and Mundane&quot;. Outside band related endeavours, Lifeson composed the theme for the first season of the science-fiction TV series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]''. He also produced three songs from the album ''[[Away from the Sun]]'' by [[3 Doors Down]]. Alex Lifeson is featured on [[Marco Minnemann]]'s 2017 release ''Borrego'', on which he played guitars on three songs and co-wrote the track &quot;On That Note&quot;. In 2018, he played lead guitar on [[Fu Manchu (band)|Fu Manchu]]'s 18-minute mostly instrumental track &quot;Il Mostro Atomico&quot; from the group's ''[[Clone of the Universe]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/av/new-music/fu-manchus-18-minute-psychedelic-stoner-epic-features-rush-guitarist-alex-lifeson|last=Kennelty|first=Greg|date=9 February 2018|accessdate=6 January 2019|title=FU MANCHU's 18-Minute Psychedelic Stoner Epic Features RUSH Guitarist Alex Lifeson|work=Metal Injection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and film appearances===
Lifeson made his film debut as himself under his birth name in the 1973 Canadian documentary film ''Come on Children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/come_on_children|title=Come on Children|last=|first=|date=|website=Rotten Tomatoes|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has appeared in several installments of the Canadian [[mockumentary]] franchise ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]''. In 2003, he was featured in an episode titled &quot;[[Closer to the Heart]]&quot;, playing a partly fictional version of himself. In the story, he is kidnapped by [[Robb Wells|Ricky]] and held as punishment for his inability (or refusal) to provide the main characters with free tickets to a Rush concert. In the end of the episode, Alex reconciles with the characters, and performs a duet of &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; with [[Mike Smith (actor)|Bubbles]] at the trailer park. In 2006, Lifeson appeared in ''[[Trailer Park Boys: The Movie]]'' as a traffic cop in the opening scene and in 2009 he appeared in their follow up movie, ''[[Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day]]'', as an undercover vice cop in drag. In 2017, Lifeson appeared in an episode of the spin-off series ''Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA'' titled &quot;Memphis.&quot;  

In 2008, Lifeson and the rest of Rush played &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; at the end of an episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. According to Colbert, this was their first appearance on American television as a band in 33 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/176340/july-16-2008/rush |title=Rush - The Colbert Report - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he and the rest of the band appeared as themselves in the comedy ''[[I Love You, Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Manohla Dargis, [https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/movies/20love.html?ref=movies Best Man Wanted. Must Be Rush Fan], [[The New York Times]], 20 March 2009 (accessed 31 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifeson appears as the border guard in the 2009 movie ''Suck''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323605/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Suck (2009)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Dr. Funtime in ''[[The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Funtime Hour]]'' was originally written with Lifeson in mind, but due to scheduling conflicts the role was given to [[Maury Chaykin]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-zaG2JLd8|title=Drunk and on Drugs Happy Funtime Hour: Behind the Scenes with Maury Chaykin|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book forewords===
Lifeson has penned forewords to three books: ''Behind the Stage Door'' by Rich Engler in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate = 20 January 2020 | url = https://www.rushisaband.com/blog/2013/12/08/3874/New-book-Behind-the-Stage-Door-from-concert-promoter-Rich-Engler-features-foreword-by-Alex-Lifeson | title = New book Behind the Stage Door from concert promoter Rich Engler features foreword by Alex Lifeson | date = 8 December 2013 | website = rushisaband.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;; ''Shredders!: The Oral History Of Speed Guitar (And More)'' by Greg Prato in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate = 20 January 2020 | url = https://www.rushisaband.com/blog/2017/03/16/4878/Greg-Patos-new-book-Shredders-The-Oral-History-Of-Speed-Guitar-featuring-a-foreword-by-Alex-Lifeson-now-available | title = Greg Prato's new book Shredders!: The Oral History Of Speed Guitar featuring a foreword by Alex Lifeson now available | date = 16 March 2017 | website = rushisaband.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and ''Geddy Lee's Big Beautiful Book of Bass'' by Geddy Lee in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate = 22 January 2020 | url = https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780062747839/geddy-lees-big-beautiful-book-of-bass/ | title = Geddy Lee's Big Beautiful Book of Bass | date = 18 December 2018 | website = harpercollins.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles==
On [[New Year's Eve#United States|New Year's Eve]] 2003, Lifeson, his son, and his daughter-in-law were arrested at the [[Ritz-Carlton]] hotel in [[Naples, Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Naples incident&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Howard W|title=The Naples incident|url=http://www.lawreport.org/ViewStory.aspx?StoryID=13796|website=Lawreport.org|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifeson, after intervening in an altercation between his son and police, was accused of assaulting a sheriff's deputy in what was described as a drunken brawl. In addition to suffering a broken nose at the hands of the officers, Lifeson was [[taser|tased]] six times. His son was also tased repeatedly.

On 21 April 2005, Lifeson and his son agreed to a plea deal with the local [[prosecutor]] for the [[State's Attorney]] office to avoid jail time by pleading [[nolo contendere|no contest]] to a first-degree [[misdemeanor]] charge of resisting arrest without violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvC8kMdwM |title=Rush' Alex Lifeson in court |publisher=YouTube |date=21 June 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the plea agreement, Lifeson and his son were each sentenced to 12 months of probation with the adjudication of that probation suspended. Lifeson acknowledged his subsequent legal action against both the Ritz-Carlton and the Collier County Sheriff's Office for &quot;their incredibly discourteous, arrogant and aggressive behaviour of which I had never experienced in thirty years of travel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Naples incident&quot;/&gt; Although both actions were initially dismissed in April 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052834/police-cleared-in-altercation-with-rushs-lifeson |title=Police Cleared In Altercation With Rush's Lifeson |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal claims against the Ritz-Carlton were reinstated upon appeal, and ultimately settled out of court in August 2008, with Lifeson and his son agreeing to a confidential settlement from Ritz-Carlton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aisling Swift |url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/aug/22/ritz-carlton-settles-lawsuit-rush-guitarists-son/ |title=Ritz-Carlton settles lawsuit with Rush guitarist’s son - Naples Daily News |publisher=Naplesnews.com |date=22 August 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his journal-based book ''Roadshow'', Peart relates the band's perspective on the events of that New Year's Eve.

==Guitar equipment==
[[Image:Alex Lifeson.jpg|Right|thumb|180px|Lifeson playing his [[Gibson Les Paul]] in the 'Heritage Cherry Sunburst'. This guitar has been modified to incorporate a [[Floyd Rose]] tremolo.]]

===Early Rush (1970s)===
In Rush's early career, Lifeson used a [[Gibson ES-335]] for the first tour, and in 1976 bought a 1974 [[Gibson Les Paul]]; he used those two guitars until the late 1970s. He had a [[Fender Stratocaster]] with a [[Bill Lawrence (guitar maker)|Bill Lawrence]] humbucker and [[Floyd Rose]] vibrato bridge as backup &quot;and for a different sound.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen&quot;/&gt; For the ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' sessions, Lifeson began using a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] for songs like &quot;[[Xanadu (Rush song)|Xanadu]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alex Lifeson Double Neck|url=http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/2015/Custom/Alex-Lifeson-Double-Neck.aspx|access-date=31 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055332/http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/2015/Custom/Alex-Lifeson-Double-Neck.aspx|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his main guitar became a white [[Gibson ES-355]].&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; During this period Lifeson used [[Hiwatt]] amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/prime-cuts-rush |title=Prime Cuts: Rush |magazine=Guitar World |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a [[Gibson B series#B-45|twelve-string Gibson B-45]] on songs like &quot;[[Closer to the Heart]].&quot;&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===
From 1980 to 1986, Lifeson used four identically modified Stratocasters, all of them equipped with the Floyd Rose bridge. As a joke, he called these Hentor Sportscasters – a made-up name inspired by Peter Henderson's name, who was the producer of ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Grace Under Pressure Tourbook |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/GUPtourbook.htm |website=Power Windows |access-date=10 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224014536/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/GUPtourbook.htm |archive-date=24 December 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would start using them again twenty years later.&lt;ref name=WesInterview&gt;{{cite web |last1=Prasad |first1=Anil |title=John Wesley - Dose of Reality |url=https://www.innerviews.org/inner/wesley.html |website=Innerviews |publicationdate=2015| accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion and an Ovation Adamas acoustic/electric guitar.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; By 1987, Lifeson switched to Signature guitar despite describing them as &quot;awful to play—very uncomfortable--...had a particular sound I liked.&quot;&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; Lifeson primarily used [[PRS Guitars|PRS guitars]] in the later-half of the 1990 Presto tour, and again during the recording of ''[[Roll The Bones]]'' in 1990/1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview: Alex Lifeson|url = http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Interview_Alex_Lifeson?page=2|website = www.premierguitar.com|access-date = 15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would continue to play PRS for the next sixteen years through the recording and touring of ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]'', ''[[Test for Echo]]'' and ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' as well as the R30 tour.

===2000s onward: Return to Gibson guitars===
In 2011, Lifeson said that for the past few years he &quot;...used Gibson almost exclusively. There's nothing like having a low-slung Les Paul over my shoulder.&quot;

====Gibson &quot;Alex Lifeson Axcess&quot;====
In early 2011, Gibson introduced the &quot;Alex Lifeson Axcess&quot;, a guitar specially designed for him. These are custom made Les Pauls with [[Floyd Rose| Floyd Rose tremolo]] systems and [[Pickup (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|piezoacoustic pick-ups]]. He used these two custom Les Pauls on the [[Time Machine Tour]]. These guitars are also available through Gibson, in a viceroy Brown or Crimson colour. Lifeson used these two guitars heavily on the tour.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

For the 2012-2013 Clockwork Angels tour, Gibson built an Alex Lifeson Axcess model in black which became Lifeson's primary guitar for much of the show.  For all acoustic work, he played one of his Axcess guitars using the piezo pick-ups; no acoustic guitars were used at all in the Clockwork Angels show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/GALLERY_Rushs_Clockwork_Angels_Tour_Gear|title=GALLERY: Rush's Clockwork Angels Tour Gear|last=Settle|first=Ken|date=12 October 2012|website=premierguitar.|access-date=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paul Reed Smith acoustic signature guitar====
For the 2015 R40 Tour, Lifeson used his signature acoustic guitar model by [[PRS Guitars|Paul Reed Smith]]. The guitar is currently available for private stock order.

====Gibson R40 Signature Les Paul Axcess====
Gibson introduced an Alex Lifeson R40 Les Paul Axcess signature guitar in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rush.com/alex-lifeson-r40-les-paul-axcess/|title=Introducing the Alex Lifeson R40 Les Paul Axcess - Rush.com|website=www.rush.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a limited edition with 50 guitars signed and played by Lifeson, and another 250 available without the signature.

====Gibson Custom Alex Lifeson Signature ES Les Paul semi-hollow====

At the 2017 Winter NAMM show, Gibson representative Mike Voltz  introduced an Antique White Gibson Custom Alex Lifeson Signature ES Les Paul semi-hollow guitar, a hybrid of a Les Paul Custom &amp; an ES 335, with only 200 made. Mike also introduced the Antique White as a new color from Gibson for this Custom (note: Gibson names this color as 'Classic White' on their web site which may be an error due to other Gibson reps labeling it as Antique White). Alex played this Custom on the last Rush tour.

In 2005, Hughes &amp; Kettner introduced an Alex Lifeson signature series amplifier; Lifeson donates his royalties from the sale of these signature models to [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TriAmp MKII Alex Lifeson |url=http://www.hughes-and-kettner.com/products.php5?id=97&amp;prod=TriAmp%20MKII%20Alex%20Lifeson |publisher=Hughes-and-kettner.com |accessdate=14 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825202747/http://www.hughes-and-kettner.com/products.php5?id=97&amp;prod=TriAmp%20MKII%20Alex%20Lifeson |archivedate=25 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Lifeson abandoned his signature Triamps in favour for custom-built Lerxst Omega [[Marshall Amplification|Silver Jubilee]] clones, handmade by Mojotone in Burgaw, NC and [[Mesa Boogie Mark Series|Mesa/Boogie Mark V]] heads. He still uses the Hughes &amp; Kettner Coreblades.

===Effects===
For [[effects unit|effects]], Lifeson is known to use [[chorus effect|chorus]], [[phase shifting]], and [[flanger|flanging]]. Throughout his career, he has used well-known pedals such as the [[Electro-Harmonix|Electro-Harmonix Electric Mistress]] flanger, the [[Boss Corporation|BOSS CE-1]] chorus, the [[Dunlop crybaby]] wah, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/new/node/32 |title=Alex Lifeson |publisher=Dinosaur Rock Guitar |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620051157/http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/new/node/32 |archivedate=20 June 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifeson and his guitar technician Scott Appleton have discussed in interviews Lifeson's use of Fractal Audio's Axe-FX, [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Mainstage (software)|MainStage]], and [[Native Instruments]]' Guitar Rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lerxstamps.com/premierguitar-com-interview-with-alex-lifeson/|title=Premier Guitar Interview: Rush’s Alex Lifeson|date=19 February 2013|work=LERXST Amplification|access-date=3 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other instruments played==
===Stringed instruments===
In addition to acoustic and electric guitars, Lifeson has also played [[mandola]], [[mandolin]] and [[bouzouki]] on recent Rush studio albums, including ''[[Test for Echo]]'', ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' and ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows]]''.

===Electronic instruments===
During live Rush performances, Lifeson uses [[MIDI controller]]s that enables him to use his free hands and feet to trigger sounds from [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] and [[synthesizer]]s, without taking his hands off his guitar. (Prior to this, Lifeson used [[Moog Taurus]] Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound &quot;events&quot; that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).&lt;ref name=&quot;onstagemag.com&quot; /&gt;

'''ArgoUML''' is an [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagramming application written in Java and released under the [[Open-source license|open source]] [[Eclipse Public License]].  By virtue of being a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application, it is available on any platform supported by [[Java SE]].

==History==
ArgoUML was originally developed at [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]] by Jason E. Robbins, leading to his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] It is now an open source project hosted by [[Tigris.org]]. The ArgoUML project now includes more than 19,000 registered users and over 150 developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isr.uci.edu/tech-transition.html |title=Tech Transitions at ISR UCI |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120128012458/http://www.isr.uci.edu/tech-transition.html |archivedate=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ArgoUML won the Software Development Magazine's annual Readers' Choice Award in the “Design and Analysis Tools” category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ddj.com/architect/184414997#designtools | title = Dr. Dobb's Readers' Choice Awards, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ArgoUML development has suffered from lack of manpower. For example, ''Undo'' has been a perpetually requested feature since 2003 but has not been implemented yet.&lt;ref&gt;Issue 1834 (May 5th, 2003): Implement undo. http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1834&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
According to the official feature list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://argouml.tigris.org/features.html | title = ArgoUML Features }}&lt;/ref&gt; ArgoUML is capable of the following: 
*All 9 UML 1.4 diagrams are supported.
*Closely follows the UML standard.
*Platform independent – Java 1.5+ and C++.
*Click and Go! with Java Web Start (no setup required, starts from your web browser).
*Standard UML 1.4 Metamodel.
*[[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]] support.
*Export diagrams as [[GIF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[PostScript|PS]], [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]], [[PGML]] and [[SVG]].
*Available in ten languages: EN, EN-GB, DE, ES, IT, RU, FR, NB, PT, ZH.
*Advanced diagram editing and zoom.
*Built-in design critics provide unobtrusive review of design and suggestions for improvements.
*Extensible modules interface.
*[[Object Constraint Language|OCL]] support.
*Forward engineering (code generation supports C++ and C#, Java, PHP&amp;nbsp;4, PHP&amp;nbsp;5, Ruby and, with less mature modules, Ada, Delphi and SQL).
*Reverse engineering / [[JAR (file format)|JAR]]/class file import.

==Weaknesses==
*ArgoUML does not yet completely implement the UML standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://argouml.tigris.org/documentation/umlsupport/index.html | work = ArgoUML documentation | title = UML Specification Incompatibility list }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Partial undo feature (working for graphics edits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=1228
|title=ArgoUML 0.19.3 released
}} Undo working for graphics edits (this is mostly a GEF addition).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

A '''file archiver''' is a [[computer program]] that combines a number of [[computer file|files]] together into one [[archive file]], or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage. File archivers may employ [[lossless data compression]] in their [[archive format]]s to reduce the size of the archive.

Basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into archives. The archive files need to store [[metadata]], at least the names and lengths of the original files, if proper reconstruction is possible. More advanced archivers store additional metadata, such as the [[Timestamping (computing)|original timestamps]], [[file attribute]]s or [[access control list]]s.

The process of making an archive file is called ''archiving'' or ''packing''. Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed ''unarchiving'', ''unpacking'' or ''extracting''.

==History==
An early archiver was the [[Multics]] command ''archive'', descended from the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]] command of the same name, which was a basic archiver and performed no compression. Multics also had a &quot;tape_archiver&quot; command, abbreviated ''ta'', which was perhaps the forerunner of unix' ''tar''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Vleck|first1=Tom|title=Multics Glossary - A|url=http://www.multicians.org/mga.html|website=multicians.org|accessdate=Jan 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unix archivers==
The [[Unix]] tools ''[[ar (Unix)|ar]]'', ''[[tar (file format)|tar]]'', ''[[cpio]]'' act as archivers but not compressors. Users of the Unix tools use additional compression tools, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], or [[XZ Utils|xz]], to compress the archive file after packing or remove compression before unpacking the archive file. The [[filename extension]]s are successively added at each step of this process. For example, archiving a collection of files with ''tar'' and then compressing the resulting archive file with ''gzip'' results a file with &lt;code&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; extension.

This approach has two goals:
#It follows the [[Unix philosophy]] that each program should accomplish a single task to perfection, as opposed to attempting to accomplish everything with one tool. As compression technology progresses, users may use different compression programs without having to modify or abandon their archiver.
#The archives use [[solid compression]]. When the files are combined, the compressor can exploit redundancy across several archived files and achieve better compression than a compressor that compresses each files individually.

This approach, however, has disadvantages too:
#Extracting or modifying one file is difficult. Extracting one file requires decompressing an entire archive, which can be time- and space-consuming. Modifying one means the file needs to be put back into archive and the archive recompressed again. This operation requires additional time and disk space.
#The archive becomes damage-prone. If the area holding shared data for several files is damaged, all those files are lost.
#It's impossible to take advantage of redundancy between files unless the compression window is larger than the size of an individual file. For example, gzip uses [[DEFLATE]], which typically operates with a 32768 byte window, whereas bzip2 uses a [[Burrows-Wheeler transform]] roughly 27 times bigger. xz defaults to 8 MiB but supports significantly larger windows.

==Windows archivers==
The built-in archiver of [[Microsoft Windows]] as well as third-party archiving software, such as [[WinRAR]] and [[7-zip]], often use a [[graphical user interface]]. They also offer an optional [[command-line interface]], while Windows itself does not. Windows archivers perform both archiving and compression. [[Solid compression]] may or may not be offered, depending on the product: Windows itself does not support it; WinRAR and 7-zip offer it as an option that can be turned on or off.

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

'''Artemis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|t|ɪ|m|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἄρτεμις}} Artemis, {{IPA-grc|ár.te.mis|att}}) is the [[Greek goddess]] of the hunt, the [[wilderness]], wild animals, the Moon, and [[chastity]].

Artemis is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin sister of [[Apollo]]. She was the patron and protector of young girls, and was believed to bring disease upon women and relieve them of it. Artemis was worshipped as one of the primary goddesses of childbirth and midwifery along with [[Eileithyia]]. Much like [[Athena]] and [[Hestia]], Artemis preferred to remain a [[Virginity|maiden]] and is sworn never to marry.

Artemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities and her [[Temple of Artemis|temple]] at Ephesus was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Artemis' symbols included a bow and arrow, a quiver and hunting knives and the [[deer]] and the [[Cupressus|cypress]] were sacred to her. The goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] is her Roman equivalent worshipped on the [[Aventine Hill]] near [[Lake Nemi]] and in [[Campania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name Artemis ([[Proper noun|''noun'']], [[Gender (linguistics)|''feminine'']]) is of unknown or uncertain etymology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Artemis|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Artemis&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Babiniotis&quot;/&gt; although various sources have been proposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew Lang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles Anthon&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Johann Theodor Jablonski|J. T. Jablonski]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles Anthon&quot;/&gt; the name is also [[Phrygia]]n and could be &quot;compared with the royal appellation ''Artemas'' of [[Xenophon]]. According to [[Charles Anthon]] the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from *''arta'', *''art'', *''arte'', all meaning &quot;great, excellent, holy,&quot; thus Artemis &quot;becomes identical with the great mother of Nature, even as she was worshipped at Ephesus&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles Anthon&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Anthon |first=Charles |author= |authorlink=Charles Anthon |authors= |editor= |encyclopedia= A Classical dictionary |title=Artemis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIYMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |date= |year=1855 |month= |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|volume= |location=New York |id= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |pages=210 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anton Goebel &quot;suggests the root στρατ or ῥατ, &quot;to shake,&quot; and makes Artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew Lang&quot;/&gt;

The name may be possibly related to [[Greek language|Greek]] ''árktos'' &quot;[[bear]]&quot; (from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] *''h₂ŕ̥tḱos''), supported by the bear cult the goddess had in [[Attica]] ([[Brauronia#Cult of Artemis Brauronia|Brauronia]]) and the [[Neolithic]] remains at the [[Arkoudiotissa Cave]], as well as the story of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], which was originally about Artemis ([[Arcadia]]n epithet ''kallisto'');&lt;ref&gt;Michaël Ripinsky-Naxon, ''The Nature of Shamanism: Substance and Function of a Religious Metaphor'' (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; this cult was a survival of very old totemic and shamanistic rituals and formed part of a larger [[bear worship|bear cult]] found further afield in other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] cultures (e.g., Gaulish [[Artio]]). It is believed that a precursor of Artemis was worshipped in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]] as the goddess of mountains and hunting, [[Britomartis]]. While connection with [[Anatolia]]n names has been suggested,&lt;ref&gt;Campanile, ''Ann. Scuola Pisa'' '''28''':305; Restelli, ''Aevum'' '''37''':307, 312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin L. Brown, &quot;In Search of Anatolian Apollo&quot;, ''Charis: Essays in Honor of Sara A. Immerwahr'', ''Hesperia Supplements'' '''33''' (2004:243–257). p. 251: Artemis, as Apollo's inseparable twin, is discussed in pp. 251ff.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest attested forms of the name ''Artemis'' are the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀳𐀖𐀵}}, ''a-te-mi-to'' /Artemitos/ and {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀴𐀖𐀳}}, ''a-ti-mi-te'' /Artimitei/, written in [[Linear B]] at [[Pylos]].&lt;ref&gt;John Chadwick and [[Lydia Baumbach]], &quot;The Mycenaean Greek Vocabulary&quot; ''Glotta'', '''41'''.3/4 (1963:157-271). p. 176f, ''s.v.'' Ἂρτεμις, ''a-te-mi-to-'' (genitive); C. Souvinous, &quot;A-TE-MI-TO and A-TI-MI-TE&quot;, ''Kadmos'' '''9''' 1970:42–47; T.

Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis was venerated in [[Lydia]] as ''Artimus''.&lt;ref&gt;''Indogermanica et Caucasica: Festschrift fur Karl Horst Schmidt zum 65.

Ancient Greek writers, by way of [[folk etymology]], and some modern scholars, have linked Artemis (Doric ''Artamis'') to ἄρταμος, ''artamos'', i.e. &quot;butcher&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/rtamos|ἄρταμος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*)/artemis|Ἄρτεμις|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or, like [[Plato]] did in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', to {{lang|grc|ἀρτεμής}}, ''artemḗs'', i.e. &quot;safe&quot;, &quot;unharmed&quot;, &quot;uninjured&quot;, &quot;pure&quot;, &quot;the stainless maiden&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew Lang&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Myth, Ritual, and Religion|first=Andrew|last=Lang|authorlink=Andrew Lang|url=https://archive.org/stream/mythritualreligi02lang#page/209/mode/1up|pages=209–210|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles Anthon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)rtemh/s|ἀρτεμής|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birth ===
[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Apollo (left) and Artemis (right). [[Brygos]] (potter, signed), [[Briseis Painter]], Tondo of an Attic red-figure cup, ca. 470 BC, [[Louvre]].]]

Various conflicting accounts are given in Classical Greek mythology regarding the birth of Artemis and Apollo, her twin brother. However, in terms of parentage, all accounts agree that she was the daughter of Zeus and [[Leto]] and that she was the twin sister of Apollo. In some sources she is born at the same time as Apollo, in others, earlier or later.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOgWfjNIxoMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=Njj29ss-a-&amp;dq=Encyclopedia%20of%20Greek%20and%20roman%20mythology%20cite&amp;lr&amp;hl=uk&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclopedia%20of%20Greek%20and%20roman%20mythology%20cite&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman Mythology|last=Roman|first=Luke|last2=Roman|first2=Monica|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=|isbn=9781438126395|location=|pages=85|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An account by [[Callimachus]] has it that Hera forbade Leto to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island. Hera was angry with her husband Zeus because he had impregnated Leto but the island of [[Delos]] disobeyed Hera and Leto gave birth there.

According to the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis the island where Leto gave birth was [[Ortygia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammond. ''Oxford Classical Dictionary.'' 597-598.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Cretan history Leto was worshipped at [[Phaistos]] and, in Cretan mythology, Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis on the islands known today as [[Paximadia (islands)|Paximadia]].

A ''[[scholium]]'' of [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on ''[[Aeneid]]'' iii. 72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia&lt;ref&gt;Or as a separate island birthplace of Artemis— &quot;Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children, the lord Apollon and Artemis who delights in arrows; her in Ortygia, and him in rocky Delos,&quot; says the [[Homeric Hymn]]; the etymology ''Ortygia'', &quot;Isle of Quail&quot;, is not supported by modern scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; by asserting that Zeus transformed Leto into a [[quail]] (''ortux'') in order to prevent Hera from finding out about his infidelity, and Kenneth McLeish suggested further that in quail form Leto would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.&lt;ref&gt;McLeish, Kenneth. ''Children of the Gods'' pp 33f; Leto's birth-pangs, however, are graphically depicted by ancient sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo. Most stories depict Artemis as born first, becoming her mother's midwife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.

=== Childhood ===
The childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth. The ''[[Iliad]]'' reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by [[Hera]], climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' XXI 505-13&lt;/ref&gt;

A poem by [[Callimachus]] to the goddess &quot;who amuses herself on mountains with archery&quot; imagines some charming vignettes. Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her ten wishes:

# to always remain a virgin
# to have many names to set her apart from her brother Phoebus ([[Apollo]])
# to have a bow and arrow made by the Cyclopes
# to be the Phaesporia or Light Bringer
# to have a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt
# to have sixty &quot;daughters of [[Okeanos]]&quot;, all nine years of age, to be her choir
# to have twenty Amnisides Nymphs as [[handmaiden]]s to watch her dogs and bow while she rested
# to rule all the mountains
# any city
# to have the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/CallimachusHymns1.html#3|title=Callimachus – Hymn III to Artemis 1-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artemis believed that she had been chosen by [[Moirai|the Fates]] to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/other/artemis.html On-line English translation].&lt;/ref&gt; All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the Moon. Callimachus tells&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Callimachus – Hymn III to Artemis 46&lt;/ref&gt; how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of [[Lipari|Lipara]], where [[Hephaestus]] and the [[Cyclopes]] worked.

Oceanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows. Callimachus then tells how Artemis visited [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god of the forest, who gave her seven female and six male dogs. She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot. Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

=== Intimacy ===
As a virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but only her hunting companion, [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], won her heart. Orion was accidentally killed either by Artemis or by Gaia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on ''[[Homer]], [[Iliad]]'' 18.486 citing Pherecydes&lt;/ref&gt;

The river god [[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheus]] was in love with Artemis, but as he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart, he decides to capture her. Artemis, who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to Alpheus, but, suspicious of his motives, she covers her face with mud so that the river god does not recognize her. In another story, Alphaeus tries to rape Artemis' attendant [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]]. Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, [[Artemis Alphaea]] in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.

Bouphagos, the son of the Titan Iapetus, sees Artemis and thinks about raping her. Reading his sinful thoughts, Artemis strikes him at Mount Pholoe.

{{anchor|Siproites}} Siproites is a boy, who, either because he accidentally sees Artemis bathing or because he attempts to rape her, is turned into a girl by the goddess.

=== Actaeon ===
Multiple versions of the Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary. The details vary but at the core, they involve a great hunter, [[Actaeon]] whom Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, &quot;The Failure of Orpheus&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''124''' (1994:163-196) p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Homo Necans'' (1972), translated by Peter Bing (University of California Press) 1983, p 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master. Sometimes they are Artemis' hounds.

According to the standard modern text on the work, Lamar Ronald Lacey's ''The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies'', the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her. For this hubris, he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds. However, in some surviving versions, Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her. According to the Latin version of the story told by the Roman [[Ovid]]&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' iii.131; see also pseudo-Apollodorus' ''Bibliotheke'' iii. 4&lt;/ref&gt; having accidentally seen Artemis (Diana) on [[Mount Cithaeron]] while she was bathing, he was changed by her into a stag, and pursued and killed by his fifty hounds.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she,&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, &quot;Aktaion and a Lost 'Bath of Artemis'&quot; ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''110''' (1990:26-42)&lt;/ref&gt; or even merely being a rival of Zeus for the affections of [[Semele]].

=== Adonis ===
[[File:Giuseppe-Mazzuoli-The-Death-of-Adonis-hermitag.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Adonis'', by [[Giuseppe Mazzuoli (1644–1725)|Giuseppe Mazzuoli]], 1709. [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.]]
In some versions of the story of [[Adonis]], Artemis sent a [[Boar|wild boar]] to kill Adonis as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than her.

In other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge. In later myths, Adonis had been related as a favorite of [[Aphrodite]], and Aphrodite was responsible for the death of [[Hippolytus (mythology)#Hippolytus as Virbius|Hippolytus]], who had been a favorite of Artemis. Therefore, Artemis killed Adonis to avenge Hippolytus's death.

In yet another version, Adonis was not killed by Artemis, but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.

=== Orion ===
[[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] was Artemis' hunting companion. In some versions, he is killed by Artemis, while in others he is killed by a [[Scorpius#Mythology|scorpion]] sent by [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. In some versions, Orion tries to seduce Opis,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Another name for Artemis herself&quot;, [[Karl Kerenyi]] observes, ''The Gods of the Greeks'' (1951:204).&lt;/ref&gt; one of Artemis' followers, and she kills him. In a version by [[Aratus]],&lt;ref&gt;Aratus, 638&lt;/ref&gt; Orion takes hold of Artemis' robe and she kills him in [[self-defense]].

In yet another version, Apollo sends the scorpion. According to [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'', ii.34, quoting the Greek poet Istrus.&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as [[Eos]] did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother Apollo, who was &quot;protective&quot; of his sister's maidenhood.

=== The Aloadae ===
The twin sons of [[Poseidon]] and [[Iphidemia]], Otos and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age. They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other. The growth of the [[Aloadae]] never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and [[Hera]] and take them as wives. The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them. The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other. In another version, Apollo sent the deer into the Aloadae's midst, causing their accidental killing of each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Callisto ===

[[File:Tizian 015.jpg|thumb|''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', c. 1556–1559, by [[Titian]]. [[Scottish National Gallery]], Edinburgh]]

[[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants. As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity. Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo gained her confidence and took advantage of her or, according to [[Ovid]], raped her. As a result of this encounter, she conceived a son, Arcas.

Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear. Arcas almost killed the bear, but Zeus stopped him just in time. Out of pity, Zeus placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of Callisto the Bear as a constellation. Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and Callisto into the heavens as bears, forming the [[Ursa Minor]] and [[Ursa Major]] constellations.

=== Iphigenia and the Taurian Artemis ===
Artemis punished [[Agamemnon]] after he killed a sacred stag in a [[sacred grove]] and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was preparing at [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] to depart for [[Troy]] to begin the [[Trojan War]], Artemis becalmed the winds. The seer [[Calchas]] advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter [[Iphigenia]]. Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer. Various myths have been told about what happened after Artemis took her. Either she was brought to Tauros and led the priests there or became Artemis' immortal companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisFavour.html#Iphigeneia |title=FAVOUR OF ARTEMIS : Greek mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |author=Aaron J. Atsma |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Niobe ===
A Queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], [[Niobe]] boasted of her superiority to Leto because while she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven boys and seven girls, Leto had only one of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.

=== Chione ===
Chione was a princess of Pokis. She was beloved by two gods, [[Hermes]] and [[Apollo]], and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once. Artemis was furious and killed Chione with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue. However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.

=== Atalanta, Oeneus and the Meleagrids ===
[[File:Artemis libation Louvre CA599.jpg|thumb|right|Artemis pouring a libation, c. 460-450 BC.]]
Artemis saved the infant [[Atalanta]] from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her. She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters. In some stories, Artemis later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because others claimed Atalanta was a superior hunter.

Among other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]], which Artemis had sent to destroy [[Calydon]] because King [[Oeneus]] had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices. In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood and was awarded the prize of the skin. She hung it in a sacred grove at [[Tegea]] as a dedication to Artemis.

[[Meleager]] was a hero of Aetolia. King [[Oeneus]] had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the [[Calydonian Boar]]. After the death of [[Meleager]], Artemis turned his grieving sisters, the [[Meleagrids]] into [[guineafowl]] that Artemis loved very much.

=== Aura ===
In [[Nonnus]] ''[[Dionysiaca]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Aura does not appear elsewhere in surviving literature and appears to have been offered no [[Cult (religion)|cult]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aura (mythology)|Aura]] was the daughter of [[Lelantos]] and [[Periboia]]. She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis and proud of her maidenhood. One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and she doubted her virginity. Artemis asked [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by [[Dionysus]]. Aura became a mad and dangerous killer. When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, [[Iacchus]], was saved by Artemis. Iacchus later became an attendant of [[Demeter]] and the leader of [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].

=== Polyphonte ===

[[Polyphonte]] was a young woman who fled home preferring the idea of a virginal life with Artemis to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite. As a punishment Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting offspring, Agrius and Oreius, were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus. Ultimately the entire family were transformed into birds and more specifically ill portents for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], Metamorphoses, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trojan War ===
Artemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother [[Apollo]] was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times. In the ''[[Iliad]]''&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' 21.470 ff).&lt;/ref&gt; she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict. Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out. As Artemis fled crying to Zeus, Leto gathered up the bow and arrows.

Artemis played quite a large part in this war. Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshipped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans. At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing [[Iphigenia]], [[Agamemnon]]'s daughter. Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke that promise. Other sources{{which|date=November 2010}} said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger. Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery. In some versions of the myth,{{which|date=November 2010}} Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into [[Hecate]], goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.

[[Aeneas]] was helped by Artemis, Leto, and Apollo. Apollo found him wounded by Diomedes and lifted him to heaven. There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.

{{Main|Brauronia}}

Artemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;“. . . a goddess universally worshipped in historical Greece, but in all likelihood pre-Hellenic.” Hammond, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Her best known [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] were on the island of [[Delos]]
(her birthplace), in Attica at [[Brauron]] and Mounikhia (near [[Piraeus]]), and in [[Sparta]]. She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows and accompanied by a deer.

The ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new [[military campaign]].

[[Athenian festivals]] in honor of Artemis included [[Elaphebolia]], [[Mounikhia]], Kharisteria, and [[Brauronia]]. The festival of [[Artemis Orthia]] was observed in [[Sparta]].

Pre-pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the [[sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron]] to serve the Goddess for one year. During this time, the girls were known as ''arktoi'', or little she-bears. A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that, over time, the bear became tame. A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes. Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged. She demanded that young girls &quot;act the bear&quot; at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Golden|Golden, M.]], ''Children and Childhood in Classical Athens'' ([[Baltimore]]: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LvV0CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT84&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 84].&lt;/ref&gt;

Artemis was worshipped as one of the primary goddesses of childbirth and midwifery along with [[Eileithyia]]. Dedications of clothing to her sanctuaries after a successful birth was common in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Wise|first=Susan|title=Childbirth Votives and Rituals in Ancient Greece|date=2007|publisher=University of Cincinnati|type=PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis could be a deity to be feared by pregnant women, as deaths during this time were contributed to her. As childbirth and pregnancy was a very common and important event, there were numerous other deities associated with it, many localized to a particular geographic area, including but not limited to [[Aphrodite]], [[Hera]] and [[Hekate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; According to [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bibliotheca|last=Pseudo-Apollodorus|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older sources, such as [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo]] (in Line 115), have the arrival of Eileithyia on Delos as the event that allows Leto to give birth to her children. Contradictory is [[Hesiod|Hesiod's]] presentation of the myth in [[Theogony]], where he states that Leto bore her children before Zeus’ marriage to Hera with no commentary on any drama related to their birth.

During the [[classical antiquity|Classical period]] in [[Athens]], she was identified with [[Hecate|Hekate]]. Artemis also assimilated [[Caryatis]] ([[Carya (goddess)|Carya]]).

She was worshipped at [[Naupactus]] as '''Aetole'''; in her temple in that town there was a statue of white marble representing her throwing a javelin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], x. 38. §&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;Aetolian Artemis&quot; would not have been introduced at Naupactus, anciently a place of [[Ozolian Locris]], until it was awarded to the [[Aetolia]]ns by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Strabo records another precinct of &quot;Aetolian Artemos&quot; at the head of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Among the Heneti certain honours have been decreed to Diomedes; and, indeed, a white horse is still sacrificed to him, and two precincts are still to be seen — one of them sacred to the Argive Hera and the other to the Aetolian Artemis. (Strabo, v.1.9 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5A*.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Agoraea]] she was the protector of the [[agora]].

As [[Artemis Orthia]] (Greek Ὀρθία) and was common to the four villages originally constituting Sparta: Limnai, in which it is situated, Pitana, Kynosoura and Mesoa.

As '''[[Agrotera]]''', she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters. In Athens Artemis was often associated with the local [[Aegina|Aeginian]] goddess, '''[[Aphaea]]'''. As '''[[Potnia Theron]]''', she was the patron of wild animals; [[Homer]] used this title. As '''[[Kourotrophos]]''', she was the nurse of youths. As '''Locheia''', she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives.

She was sometimes known as '''[[Cynthia]]''', from her birthplace on [[Cynthus|Mount Cynthus]] on [[Delos]], or '''Amarynthia''' from a festival in her honor originally held at Amarynthus in [[Euboea]].

She was sometimes identified by the name '''[[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]]''', the feminine form of her brother Apollo's solar epithet [[Phoebus]].

'''Alphaea''', '''Alpheaea''', or '''Alpheiusa''' ([[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] {{lang|grc|Ἀλφαῖα}}, {{lang|grc|Ἀλφεαία}}, or {{lang|grc|Ἀλφειοῦσα}}) was an epithet that Artemis derived from the river god [[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheius]], who was said to have been in love with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Schmitz | first = Leonhard | authorlink = Leonhard Schmitz | title = Alphaea | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 133 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0142.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was under this name that she was worshipped at Letrini in [[Elis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' vi. 22. §&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'' viii. p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ortygia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] on [[Pindar]]'s ''Pythian Odes'' ii. 12, ''Nemean Odes'' i. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis Alphaea was associated with the wearing of masks, largely because of the legend that while fleeing the advances of Alpheius, she and her [[nymph]]s escaped him by covering their faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = G. | last = Dickins | authorlink = | author2 = Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies | title = Terracotta Masks | booktitle = The Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia: Supplementary Papers | pages = 172 | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers]] | year = 1929 | location = London, England | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=bFlZAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As '''Artemis Anaitis''', the 'Persian Artemis' was identified with [[Anahita]]. As [[Apanchomene]], she was worshipped as a hanged goddess.

{{anchor|Tauropolos}}She was also worshiped as '''Artemis Tauropolos''', variously interpreted as &quot;worshipped at [[Taurica|Tauris]]&quot;, &quot;pulled by a yoke of bulls&quot;, or &quot;hunting bull goddess&quot;. A statue of Artemis &quot;Tauropolos&quot; in her temple at [[Brauron]] in Attica was supposed to have been brought from the [[Crimea|Taurians]] by [[Iphigenia]]. Tauropolia was also a festival of Artemis in [[Athens]]. There was a ''Tauropolion'', a temple in a ''[[temenos]]'' sacred to Artemis Tauropolos, in the north Aegean island of Doliche (now [[Ikaria]]). There is a Temple to 'Artemis Tauropolos' (as well as a smaller temple to an unknown goddess about {{convert|262|m|abbr=off}} south, on the beach) located on the eastern shore of Attica, in the modern town of Artemida (Loutsa). An aspect of the Taurian Artemis was also worshipped as [[Aricina]].

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] at the [[Description of Greece]] writes that near [[Pyrrhichus]] there was a sanctuary of Artemis, called '''Astrateias''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀστρατείας}}), with image of the goddess said to have been dedicated by the [[Amazons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-grc1:3.25.3 Pausanias, Description of Greece, § 3.25.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attributes ==
===Virginity===
An important aspect of Artemis' persona and worship was her virginity, which may seem contradictory given her role as a goddess associated with childbirth. It is likely that the idea of Artemis as a virgin goddess is related to her primary role as a huntress. Hunters traditionally abstained from sex prior to the hunt as a form of ritual purity and out of a belief that the scent would scare off potential prey. The ancient cultural context in which Artemis' worship emerged also held that virginity was a prerequisite to marriage, and that a married woman became subservient to her husband. In this light, Artemis' virginity is also related to her power and independence. Rather than a form of asexuality, it is an attribute that signals Artemis as her own master, with power equal to that of male gods. It is also possible that her virginity represents a concentration of fertility that can be spread among her followers, in the manner of earlier mother goddess figures. However, some later Greek writers did come to treat Artemis as inherently asexual and as an opposite to [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref name=Hjerrild&gt;Hjerrild, B. (2009). Near Eastern equivalents to Artemis. Tobias Fischer-Hansen &amp; Birte Poulsen, eds. ''From Artemis to Diana: The Goddess of Man and Beast''. Museum Tusculanum Press. {{ISBN|8763507889}}, 9788763507882.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a mother goddess===
Despite her virginity, both modern scholars and ancient commentaries have linked Artemis to the archetype of the [[mother goddess]]. Artemis was traditionally linked to fertility and was petitioned to assist women with childbirth. According to [[Herodotus]], the Greek playwright [[Aeschylus]] identified Artemis with [[Persephone]] as a daughter of [[Demeter]]. Her worshipers in [[Arcadia]] also traditionally associated her with Demeter and Persephone. In [[Asia Minor]], she was often conflated with local mother goddess figures, such as [[Cybele]], and [[Anahita]] in [[Iran]]. However, the archetype of the mother goddess was not highly compatible with the Greek pantheon, and though the Greeks had adopted worship of Cybele and other Anatolian mother goddesses as early as the 7th century BCE, she was not directly conflated with any Greek goddesses; instead, bits and pieces of her worship and aspects were absorbed variously by Artemis, Aphrodite, and others as Eastern influence spread.&lt;ref name=Hjerrild/&gt;

=== As the Lady of Ephesus ===
{{Main|Temple of Artemis}}
[[File:The Artemis of Ephesus.jpg|thumb|right|The Artemis of Ephesus, 1st century AD ([[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]])]]

At Ephesus in [[Ionia]], Turkey, her temple became one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]]. It was probably the best known center of her worship except for Delos. There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' was worshipped primarily as a [[mother goddess]], akin to the Phrygian goddess [[Cybele]], in an ancient sanctuary where her [[cult image]] depicted the &quot;Lady of Ephesus&quot; adorned with multiple large beads. Excavation at the site of the ''Artemision'' in 1987–88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped [[amber]] beads that had been hung on the original wooden statue (''[[xoanon]]''), and these were probably carried over into later sculpted copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/98868504/49-MORRIS-Potnia-Aswiya-Anatolian-Greek-Religion|title=&quot;Potnia Aswia: Anatolian Contributions to Greek Religion&quot; by Sarah P.

===Symbols===
* '''Bow and arrow'''

According to the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis, she had golden bow and arrows, as her epithet was '''Khryselakatos''' (&quot;of the Golden Shaft&quot;) and '''Iokheira''' (&quot;showered by arrows&quot;). The arrows of Artemis could also bring sudden death and disease to girls and women. Artemis got her bow and arrow for the first time from The Kyklopes, as the one she asked from her father. The bow of Artemis also became the witness of Callisto's oath of her virginity. In later cult, the bow became the symbol of waxing moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Bow |title= Bow |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chariots'''
Artemis' chariot was made of gold and was pulled by four golden horned deer (Elaphoi Khrysokeroi).

* '''Spears, nets, and lyre'''
&lt;!-- [[File:Artemis Spear.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=0.56|Artemis With A Hunting Spear, a statue at Venetia. {{deletable image-caption}}]]--&gt;
Although quite seldom, Artemis is sometimes portrayed with a hunting spear. Her cult in Aetolia, the Artemis Aetolian, showed her with a hunting spear. The description about Artemis' spear can be found in Ovid's Metamorphosis,{{Where|date=July 2011}} while Artemis with a fishing spear connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Spears |title= Spears|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a goddess of maiden dances and songs, Artemis is often portrayed with a lyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisGoddess.html#Dance |title= Dance |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Deer]]'''
Deer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself. On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred. Deer were also the first animals she captured. She caught five golden horned deer called '''Elaphoi Khrysokeroi''' and harnessed them to her chariot.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; The [[Labours of Hercules|third labour of Heracles]], commanded by [[Eurystheus]], consisted of catching the [[Cerynitian Hind]] alive. Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive.

* '''Hunting dog'''
Artemis got her hunting dogs from [[Pan (god)|Pan]] in the forest of Arcadia. Pan gave Artemis two black-and-white dogs, three reddish ones, and one spotted one – these dogs were able to hunt even lions. Pan also gave Artemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race. However, Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Pack|title=Pack |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bear]]'''
The sacrifice of a bear for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague.

== In art ==
[[File:Bust of the goddess of Issa, Vis Museum, Croatia.JPG|thumb|right|Fourth century [[Praxiteles|Praxitelean]] bronze head of a goddess wearing a [[lunate]] crown, found at Issa ([[Vis (island)|Vis]], Croatia).]]

The oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as [[Potnia Theron]] (&quot;Queen of the Beasts&quot;): a winged goddess holding a stag and lioness in her hands, or sometimes a lioness and a lion. This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as [[Artemis Orthia]], with a sanctuary close by [[Sparta]].

In Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt,&lt;ref&gt;Homer portrayed Artemis as girlish in the ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow&lt;ref&gt;Greek poets could not decide whether her bow was silver or gold: &quot;Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow.&quot; ([[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis), and it is a golden bow as well in [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 1.693, where her nymph's is of horn. &quot;And how often goddess, didst thou make trial of thy silver bow?&quot;, asks [[Callimachus]] for whom it is a [[Cydonia (ancient Greece)|Cydonian]] bow that the [[Cyclopes]] make for her (Callimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis).&lt;/ref&gt; and arrows. Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a [[hunting dog]] or stag. When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of [[Niobe]].

Artemis was sometimes represented in Classical art with the crown of the [[crescent]] [[moon]], such as also found on [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]] and others.

On June 7, 2007, a Roman era bronze sculpture of ''[[Artemis and the Stag]]'' was sold at [[Sotheby's]] auction house in New York state by the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] for $25.5 million.

== Legacy ==
===In astronomy===
[[105 Artemis]], the [[Artemis (crater)]], the [[Artemis Chasma]], the [[Artemis Corona]], and the [[Artemis program|Artemis lunar program]] have all been named after the goddess.

Artemis is the acronym for &quot;Architectures de bolometres pour des Telescopes a grand champ de vue dans le domaine sub-Millimetrique au Sol&quot;, a large [[bolometer]] camera in the [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] range that was installed in 2010 at the [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] (APEX), located in the [[Atacama desert|Atacama Desert]] in northern Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apex-telescope.org/instruments/pi/artemis/ |title=APEX – Artemis |publisher=Apex-telescope.org |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In taxonomy ===
The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] genus ''[[Artemia]]'', which entirely comprises the family Artemiidae, derives from Artemis. ''Artemia'' are aquatic crustaceans known as brine shrimp, the best known species of which, ''[[Artemia salina]]'', or [[Sea Monkeys]], was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in 1758. ''Artemia'' live in salt lakes, and although they are almost never found in an open sea, they do appear along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean coast]] near [[Ephesus]], where the [[Temple of Artemis]] once stood.

=== In Modern Spaceflight ===
The [[Artemis program]] is an ongoing [[List of human spaceflight programs|crewed spaceflight program]] carried out by [[NASA]], U.S. [[Private spaceflight|commercial spaceflight companies]], and international partners such as [[European Space Agency|ESA]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Artemis home&quot;&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/specials/moon2mars/]. NASA. Accessed on 19 May 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of landing &quot;the first woman and the next man&quot; on the [[lunar south pole]] region by 2024. NASA is calling this the Artemis program in honor of Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology, the goddess of the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vice President Unveils NASA Spacecraft for Artemis 1 Lunar Mission on Moon Landing Anniversary&quot;&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/vice-president-unveils-nasa-spacecraft-for-artemis-1-lunar-mission-on-moon-landing].

[[File:Entrance Auschwitz I.jpg|thumb|Slogan displayed at [[Auschwitz]]]]
[[File:Czech-2013-Theresienstadt-Arbeit Macht Frei (detail).jpg|thumb|[[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] in the Czech Republic]]
'''{{lang|de|Arbeit macht frei}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaɐ̯baɪt ˈmaxt ˈfʁaɪ||De-Arbeit macht frei.ogg}}) is a German phrase meaning &quot;work sets you free&quot;. The slogan is known for appearing on the entrance of [[Auschwitz]] and other [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]'', [[Yad Vashem]],  1990, vol. 4, p. 1751.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The expression comes from the title of an 1873 novel by German [[Philology|philologist]] [[Lorenz Diefenbach]], {{lang|de|Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach}}, in which gamblers and fraudsters find the path to virtue through labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/18/auschwitz-arbeit-macht-frei-sign|title=Poland declares state of emergency after 'Arbeit Macht Frei' stolen from Auschwitz|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2009-12-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4tlbAAAAcAAJ|quote=diefenbach arbeit macht frei.|title=Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach|last=Diefenbach|first=Lorenz|date=1873|publisher=J. Kühtmann's Buchhandlung|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used in French ({{lang|fr|le travail rend libre!}})  by [[Auguste Forel]], a Swiss entomologist, neuroanatomist and psychiatrist, in his {{lang|fr|Fourmis de la Suisse}} (''English'': &quot;Ants of Switzerland&quot;) (1920).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fourmis de la Suisse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/lesfourmisdelasu00fore#page/n7/mode/2up |title=Les fourmis de la Suisse (2nd Ed.) |first=Auguste |last=Forel |authorlink=Auguste Forel|location=La Chaux-de-Fonds |publisher=Imprimarie cooperative |year=1920 |language=French |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the {{lang|de|Deutsche Schulverein}} of Vienna, an ethnic nationalist &quot;protective&quot; organization of Germans within the Austrian empire, printed membership stamps with the phrase {{lang|de|Arbeit macht frei}}.
According to visitcracow.com: “In the 1930s, they (Nazis) promoted programs against unemployment through this sentence.”

The phrase is also evocative of the medieval German principle of ''[[Stadtluft macht frei]]'' (&quot;urban air makes you free&quot;), according to which [[Serfdom|serfs]] were liberated after being a city resident for [[Year and a day rule|one year and one day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.br.de/nachrichten/bayern/stadtluft-macht-frei-sibler-bedauert-geweckte-assoziationen,RLkOSOe |language=de |title=&quot;Stadtluft macht frei&quot;: Minister bedauert Irritationen |date=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan {{Lang|de|Arbeit macht frei}} was placed at the entrances to a number of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s. The slogan's use was implemented by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Theodor Eicke]] at [[Dachau concentration camp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOD9ncsixssC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=arbeit+macht+frei+%22eicke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc2bjf2uTdAhUITKwKHRNGCUEQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=arbeit%20macht%20frei%20%22eicke%22&amp;f=false|title=Legacies of Dachau: The Uses and Abuses of a Concentration Camp, 1933-2001|last=Marcuse|first=Harold|date=2001-03-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521552042|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then copied by [[Rudolf Höss]] at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/auschwitz/40-45/beginnings/|title=Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State . Auschwitz 1940-1945 . Surprising Beginnings {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan can still be seen at several sites, including over the entrance to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]] where the sign was erected by order of commandant [[Rudolf Höss]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurence Rees]], ''Auschwitz: a New History''&lt;/ref&gt;The Auschwitz I sign was made by prisoner-labourers including master [[blacksmith]] [[Jan Liwacz]], and features an upside-down ''B'', which has been interpreted as an act of defiance by the prisoners who made it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auschwitz's sign of death and defiance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8420681.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B - the sculpture|url=http://www.auschwitz.info/en/b-the-sculpture.html| website=International Auschwitz Committee| accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of ridiculing the falsity of the slogan was a popular saying used among Auschwitz prisoners: 

'''''Arbeit macht frei''' (Work makes you free)''

'''''durch Krematorium Nummer drei''' (Through Krematorium Number Three)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://krakowdirect.com/arbeit-macht-frei-facts-auschwitz-gate/|title=Arbeit macht frei - facts about Auschwitz gate|date=2019-07-05|website=Krakow Direct|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 the first political prisoners were being rounded up for an indefinite period without charges. They were held in a number of places in Germany. The slogan was first used over the gate of a &quot;wild camp&quot; in the city of [[Oranienburg concentration camp|Oranienburg]], which was set up in an abandoned brewery in March 1933 (it was later rebuilt in 1936 as [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It can also be seen at the Dachau, [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]], and [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt]] camps, as well as at [[Fort Breendonk]] in [[Belgium]]. It has been claimed that the slogan was placed over the entrance gates of the [[Monowitz concentration camp|Monowitz]] camp (also known as Auschwitz III).&lt;ref&gt;Denis Avey with Rob Broomby ''The Man who Broke into Auschwitz'', Hodder and Stoughton, London, 2011 p.236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freddie Knoller with Robert Landaw ''Desperate Journey: Vienna-Paris-Auschwitz'', Metro, London, 2002, {{ISBN|978-184-358028-7}} p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan appeared at the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] camp on the left gate post at the camp entry. The original gate posts survive in another part of the camp, but the slogan sign no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;KZ-Gedenkstaette Flossenbuerg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primo Levi]] describes seeing the words illuminated over a doorway (as distinct from a gate) at Monowitz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Primo Levi|Levi, Primo]], trans. Stuart Woolf, ''[[If This Is a Man]]''. Abacus, London, 2004, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 the [[Austria]]n political [[cabaret]] writer [[Jura Soyfer]] and the [[composer]] [[Herbert Zipper]], while prisoners at [[Dachau Concentration Camp]], wrote the ''[[Dachaulied]]'', or ''The'' ''Dachau'' ''Song''. They had spent weeks marching in and out of the camp's gate to daily [[forced labour]], and considered the motto {{Lang|De|Arbeit macht frei}} over the gate an insult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The song repeats the phrase cynically as a &quot;lesson&quot; taught by Dachau.

In ''The Kingdom of Auschwitz'', [[Otto Friedrich]] wrote about [[Rudolf Höss]], regarding his decision to display the motto so prominently at the Auschwitz entrance:

{{quote|He seems not to have intended it as a mockery, nor even to have intended it literally, as a false promise that those who worked to exhaustion would eventually be released, but rather as a kind of mystical declaration that self-sacrifice in the form of endless labor does in itself bring a kind of spiritual freedom.&lt;ref name=Friedrich&gt;{{cite book |last= Friedrich |first= Otto |title= The Kingdom of Auschwitz |publisher= [[Harper Perennial]] |date=August 1994 |isbn= 978-0-06-097640-8 |pages= 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The signs are prominently displayed, and were seen by all prisoners and staff&amp;mdash; all of whom knew, suspected, or quickly learned that prisoners confined there would likely only be freed by death. The signs' psychological impact was tremendous.&lt;ref name=Friedrich/&gt;

==Thefts of {{Lang|De|Arbeit Macht Frei}} signs==
The {{Lang|De|Arbeit Macht Frei}} sign over the Auschwitz I gate was stolen in December 2009 and later recovered by authorities in three pieces. Anders Högström, a Swedish neo-Nazi, and two Polish men were jailed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/former-neo-nazi-jailed-for-auschwitz-sign-theft-2172533.html|title=Former neo-Nazi jailed for Auschwitz sign theft|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sign is now in storage at the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] and a replica was put over the gate in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12094855 | work=BBC News | title=Auschwitz sign theft: Swedish man jailed | date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2014, the sign over the Dachau gate was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29878278 | work=BBC News | title=Dachau infamous Nazi concentration camp gate stolen | date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found on 28 November 2016 under a tarpaulin at a parking lot in [[Ytre Arna]], a settlement north of [[Bergen]], Norway's second-largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/i/XyLgo/stjaalet-arbeit-macht-frei-port-funnet-i-bergen|title=Stjålet «Arbeit macht frei»-port funnet i Bergen|access-date=2018-10-01|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/221193|title='No usable evidence' in investigation into stolen Dachau sign|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and background===
Axayacatl was a son of the princess [[Atotoztli II]] and her cousin, prince [[Tezozomoc (son of Itzcoatl)|Tezozomoc]]. He was a grandson of the Emperors [[Moctezuma I]] and [[Itzcoatl]]. He was a descendant of the king [[Cuauhtototzin]].

He was a successor of Moctezuma and his brothers were Emperors [[Tizoc]] and [[Ahuitzotl]] and his sister was the Queen [[Chalchiuhnenetzin]]. He was an uncle of the Emperor [[Cuauhtémoc]] and father of Emperors [[Moctezuma II]] and [[Cuitláhuac]].

===Rise to power===
During his youth, his military prowess gained him the favor influential figures such as [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] and [[Tlacaelel I]], and thus, upon the death of [[Moctezuma I]] in 1469, he was chosen to ascend to the throne, much to the displeasure of his two older brothers, [[Tizoc]] and [[Ahuitzotl]].

It is also important that the [[Aztec calendar stone|Great Sun Stone]], also known as the Aztec Calendar, was carved under his leadership. In the year 1475 there was a major earthquake that destroyed many homes in Tenochtitlán.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://staging.doaks.org/research/publications/doaks-online-publications/palaces-of-the-ancient-new-world/isbn-0-88402-300-1.pdf#page=16 |title=Palaces of the Ancient New World |last=Evans |first=Susan Toby |last2=Pillsbury |first2=Joanne |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection |year=1998 |isbn=0-88402-300-1 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military actions and death===
Using as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few Tlatelolcan citizens, Axayacatl invaded his neighbor, killed its ruler, [[Moquihuix]], and replaced him with a military governor. The Tlatelolcans lost any voice they had in forming Aztec policy.

Axayacatl largely dedicated his twelve-year reign to consolidating his militaristic repute: he led successful [[Aztec warfare|campaigns]] against the neighboring {{lang|nci|altepetl}} of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] in 1473 (see [[Battle of Tlatelolco]]) and the [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]] of the [[Toluca Valley]] in 1474, but was finally defeated by the [[Purépecha people|Tarascan]]s of [[Michoacán]] in 1476. Despite some subsequent minor triumphs, Axayacatl's defeat at the hands of the Tarascans irreversibly marred his image, as it constituted the only major defeat suffered by the Aztecs up to that moment. In spite of his young age, he fell gravely ill in 1480, passing away a mere year later, in 1481, whereupon he was succeeded by his brother Tizoc.

===Axayacatl the poet===
Axayacatl wrote two poems. The first, ''Ycuic Axayayatzin'' (English: &quot;Song of Axayacatl&quot;) is a defense against his brothers and critics; the second, ''Huehue cuicatl'' (English: &quot;Song of the Ancients&quot;) is a lament written after his defeat in Michoacan.&lt;ref name=&quot;azteca&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Trece Poetas del Mundo Azteca|author=Miguel Leon-Portilla|publisher=Universidad Nacinal Autonoma de Mexico|date=1978|location=Mexico City|edition=2nd, 1972|language=Spanish|trans-title=Thirteen Poets of the Aztec World|pages=133–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The ''Obsidian and Blood'' series by [[Aliette de Bodard]] are set in the last year of the reign of Axayacatl and the first years of the reign of [[Tizoc]], with their youngest brother [[Ahuitzotl]] appearing as a primary character.

'''Ahuitzotl''' ({{lang-nah|[[wikt:ahuitzotl|āhuitzotl]]}}, {{IPA-nah|aːˈwit͡sot͡ɬ|-|Awisotl.ogg}}) was the eighth Aztec ruler, the ''[[Tlatoani|Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the city of [[Tenochtitlan]], son of princess [[Atotoztli II]]. His name literally means &quot;Water Thorny&quot; and was also applied to the otter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahuítzotl, “El espinoso del agua” (1486-1502)|url=https://arqueologiamexicana.mx/mexico-antiguo/ahuitzotl-el-espinoso-del-agua-1486-1502|website=Archeologia Mexicana|language=Spanish |accessdate=June 4, 2019|trans-title=Ahuítzotl, &quot;Thorny Water&quot; (1486-1502)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for much of the expansion of the Mexica domain, and consolidated the empire's power after emulating his predecessor. He took power as [[Tlatoani]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|7 Rabbit]] (1486), after the death of his predecessor and brother, [[Tizoc]].

He had two sons, the kings [[Chimalpilli II]] and [[Cuauhtémoc]], and one daughter.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Biography==
Perhaps the greatest known military leader of [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], Ahuizotl began his reign by suppressing a [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] rebellion, and then swiftly more than doubled the size of lands under Aztec dominance. He conquered the [[Mixtec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], and other peoples from [[Pacific Coast of Mexico]] down to the western part of [[Guatemala]]. Ahuizotl also supervised a major rebuilding of Tenochtitlan on a grander scale including the expansion of the Great Pyramid or [[Templo Mayor]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|8 Reed]] (1487).

He presided over the introduction of the [[great-tailed grackle]] into the Valley of Mexico, the earliest documented case of human-mediated bird introduction in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction of the Great-tailed Grackle (''Quiscalus mexicanus'') by Aztec Emperor Auitzotl: Provenance of the historical account (La Introducción de la Quiscalus mexicanus por el Emperador Azteca Auitzotl: Origen del Relato Histórico)|first=Paul D.|last=Haemig|work=The Auk|volume=129|number=1|date=January 2012|pages=70–75|publisher=University of California Press|jstor=10.1525/auk.2011.11058|doi=10.1525/auk.2011.11058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahuizotl died in the year [[Aztec calendar|10 Rabbit]] (1502) and was succeeded by his nephew, [[Moctezuma II]].

Ahuizotl took his name from the [[Ahuizotl (mythology)|animal ahuizotl]], which the Aztecs considered to be a legendary creature in its own right rather than a mere mythical representation of the king.

==In popular culture==
Under the name Teomitl, Ahuitzotl is a primary character in the ''Obsidian and Blood'' series by [[Aliette de Bodard]], which are set in the last year of the reign of [[Axayacatl]] and the first years of the reign of [[Tizoc]].
In the historical fiction novel, &quot;Aztec&quot; by Gary Jennings, Ahuitzotl is a prominent character. Set in the time just before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors, it accounts his construction of the many expansions of Tenochtitlan, and wars of conquest, trade, and proclivities.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Albinism''' is a [[congenital disorder]] characterized in humans by the complete or partial absence of [[Biological pigment|pigment]] in the skin, hair and eyes. Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as [[photophobia]], [[nystagmus]], and [[amblyopia]]. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers. In rare cases such as [[Chédiak–Higashi syndrome]], albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules. This also affects essential granules present in immune cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=J. |last2=De Domenico |first2=I. |last3=Ward |first3=D. M. |doi=10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f2bcce |title=Chediak-Higashi syndrome |journal=Current Opinion in Hematology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=22–29 |date=2008 |pmid=18043242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Albinism results from inheritance of [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive gene]] [[allele]]s and is known to affect all [[vertebrate]]s, including [[human]]s. It is due to absence or defect of [[tyrosinase]], a copper-containing enzyme involved in the production of [[melanin]]. It is the opposite of [[melanism]].  Unlike humans, other animals have multiple [[Biological pigments|pigments]] and for these, [[Albinism in biology|albinism]] is considered to be a hereditary condition characterised by the absence of melanin in particular, in the eyes, skin, hair, scales, feathers or cuticle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12993/albinism |title=Albinism |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an organism with complete absence of melanin is called an albino, an organism with only a diminished amount of melanin is described as [[Leucism|leucistic]] or albinoid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tietz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tietz |first=W. |title=A Syndrome of Deaf-Mutism Associated with Albinism Showing Dominant Autosomal Inheritance |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=15 |pages=259–264 |pmid=13985019 |pmc=1932384 |date=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is from the [[Latin]] ''albus'', &quot;white&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Albinistic girl papua new guinea.jpg|thumb|left|Girl with albinism from [[Papua New Guinea]]]]There are two principal types of albinism: [[Oculocutaneous albinism|oculocutaneous]], affecting the eyes, skin and hair, and [[Ocular albinism|ocular]] affecting the eyes only.

There are different types of oculocutaneous albinism depending on which gene has undergone mutation. With some there is no pigment at all. The other end of the spectrum of albinism is &quot;a form of albinism called rufous oculocutaneous albinism, which usually affects dark-skinned people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/oculocutaneous-albinism |title=oculocutaneous albinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Genetics Home Reference |publisher=[[U.S. National Library of Medicine]], [[National Institutes of Health]] |location=Bethesda, Maryland |date=October 2015 |access-date=10 November 2017}}{{tertiary source|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation]], &quot;With ocular albinism, the color of the iris of the eye may vary from blue to green or even brown, and sometimes darkens with age. However, when an optometrist or ophthalmologist examines the eye by shining a light from the side of the eye, the light shines back through the iris since very little pigment is present.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Information Bulletin - Ocular Albinism |url=http://www.albinism.org/site/c.flKYIdOUIhJ4H/b.9260357/k.A94A/Information_Bulletin__Ocular_Albinism.htm |publisher=National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation |access-date=11 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312070207/http://www.albinism.org/site/c.flKYIdOUIhJ4H/b.9260357/k.A94A/Information_Bulletin__Ocular_Albinism.htm |archive-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because individuals with albinism have skin that entirely lacks the dark pigment melanin, which helps protect the skin from the sun's [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]], their skin can [[sunburn|burn]] more easily from overexposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Chen |first=Harold |title=Atlas of genetic diagnosis and counseling |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, New Jersey |date=2006 |pages=37–40 |isbn=978-1-58829-681-8 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=2VcdAXJ_dZkC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Albinism&amp;q=Albinism |access-date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human eye normally produces enough pigment to color the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] blue, green or brown and lend opacity to the eye. In photographs, those with albinism are more likely to demonstrate &quot;red eye&quot;, due to the red of the [[retina]] being visible through the iris. Lack of pigment in the eyes also results in problems with vision, both related and unrelated to [[photosensitivity]].

Those with albinism are generally as healthy as the rest of the population (but see related disorders below), with growth and development occurring as normal, and albinism by itself does not cause mortality,&lt;ref name=&quot;eMedicine1&quot; /&gt; although the lack of pigment blocking [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] increases the risk of melanomas (skin cancers) and other problems.

===Visual problems===

Development of the optical system is highly dependent on the presence of melanin. For this reason, the reduction or absence of this pigment in people with albinism may lead to:
* Misrouting of the retinogeniculate projections, resulting in abnormal [[decussation]] (crossing) of optic nerve fibres&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot; /&gt;

* Reduced visual acuity due to [[Macular hypoplasia|foveal hypoplasia]] and possibly light-induced [[retina]]l damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot; /&gt;

Eye conditions common in albinism include:
* [[Nystagmus]], irregular rapid movement of the eyes back and forth, or in circular motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot; /&gt;
* [[Amblyopia]], decrease in acuity of one or both eyes due to poor transmission to the brain, often due to other conditions such as [[strabismus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot; /&gt;
* [[Optic nerve hypoplasia]], underdevelopment of the optic nerve.

The improper development of the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE), which in normal eyes absorbs most of the reflected sunlight, further increases glare due to light scattering within the eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Optometry Albinism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Albinism |pages=63A–65A |url=https://www.reviewofoptometry.com/CMSDocuments/2009/9/ro0409_handbook.pdf |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824100916/https://www.reviewofoptometry.com/CMSDocuments/2009/9/ro0409_handbook.pdf |archive-date=24 August 2015 |work=The Handbook of Ocular Disease Management: Supplement to Review of Optometry |first1=Joseph W. |last1=Sowka |first2=Andrew S. |last2=Gurwood |first3=Allan G. |last3=Kabat |publisher=Jobson Medical Information |location=New York |edition=11th |date=15 April 2009 |via=ReviewOfOptometry.com |access-date=10 November 2017 |df= }}&lt;!--Note: Albinism has been removed, for some reason, from at least the 12th (2010) through 18th (2016) editions.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting sensitivity (photophobia) generally leads to discomfort in bright light, but this can be reduced by the use of sunglasses or brimmed hats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts Albinism&quot; /&gt;

==Genetics==
[[Oculocutaneous albinism]] is generally the result of the [[biological inheritance]] of [[dominance relationship|genetically recessive]] [[allele]]s ([[gene]]s) passed from both parents of an individual such as [[OCA1]] and [[OCA2]].  A mutation in the human TRP-1 gene may result in the deregulation of melanocyte tyrosinase enzymes, a change that is hypothesized to promote brown versus black melanin synthesis, resulting in a third oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) genotype, &quot;OCA3&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mutation in and lack of expression of tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1) in melanocytes from an individual with brown oculocutaneous albinism: A new subtype of albinism classified as &quot;OCA3&quot; |last1=Boissy |first1=R. E. |last2=Zhao |first2=H. |last3=Oetting |first3=W. S. |last4=Austin |first4=L. M. |last5=Wildenberg |first5=S. C. |last6=Boissy |first6=Y. L. |last7=Zhao |first7=Y. |last8=Sturm |first8=R.

J. |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=58 |issue=6 |date=1996 |pages=1145–1156 |pmid=8651291 |pmc=1915069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rare forms are inherited from only one parent. There are other [[genetic mutation]]s which are proven to be associated with albinism. All alterations, however, lead to changes in melanin production in the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;eMedicine1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Boissy |first=Raymond E. |title=Dermatologic Manifestations of Albinism |date=21 July 2016 |url= https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1068184-overview |work=[[Medscape]] |editor-first=William D. |editor1-last=James |display-editors=etal |publisher=[[eMedicine]] / [[WebMD]] |access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMIM1&quot;&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=omim&amp;term=albinism Online ''Mendelian Inheritance in Man''], at [[Johns Hopkins University]] {{crossref|(see also [[Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] for more information about this source)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these are associated with increased risk of skin cancer {{crossref|([[List of cutaneous conditions associated with increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer|see list of such genetic variations]])}}.

The chance of offspring with albinism resulting from the pairing of an organism with albinism and one without albinism is low. However, because organisms (including humans) can be carriers of genes for albinism without exhibiting any traits, albinistic offspring can be produced by two non-albinistic parents. Albinism usually occurs with equal frequency in both sexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;eMedicine1&quot; /&gt; An exception to this is [[ocular albinism]], which it is passed on to offspring through X-linked inheritance. Thus, ocular albinism occurs more frequently in males as they have a single X and Y [[chromosome]], unlike females, whose genetics are characterized by two X&amp;nbsp;chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Haldeman-Englert |first=Chad |url= https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002051.htm |title=Sex-linked recessive |work=The ADAM Medical Encyclopedia |date=6 November 2017 | publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health / Ebix Inc. |location=Bethesda, Maryland / Atlanta, Georgia, US |access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different forms of albinism: a partial lack of the melanin is known as hypomelanism, or hypomelanosis, and the total absence of melanin is known as [[amelanism]] or amelanosis.

===Enzyme===
The enzyme defect responsible for OCA1-type albinism is tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (tyrosinase), which synthesizes melanin from the amino acid [[tyrosine]].

===Evolutionary theories===
It is suggested that the early [[hominin]] evolved in East Africa around 3 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalsocietypublishing.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greaves |first=M. |date=2014 |title=Was skin cancer a selective force for black pigmentation in early hominin evolution? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=281 |issue=1781 |pages=20132955 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2955 |pmid=24573849 |pmc=3953838}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic [[phenotype|phenotypic]] change from [[primate]] to early hominin is hypothesized to have involved the extreme loss of body hair – except for areas most exposed to UV radiation, such as the head – to allow for more efficient [[thermoregulation]] in the early hunter-gatherers. The skin that would have been exposed upon general body hair loss in these early hominins would have most likely been non-pigmented, reflecting the pale skin underlying the hair of our chimpanzee relatives. A positive advantage would have been conferred to early hominids inhabiting the African continent that were capable of producing darker skin – those who first expressed the [[eumelanin]]-producing [[MC1R]] [[allele]] – which protected them from harmful epithelium-damaging ultraviolet rays. Over time, the advantage conferred to those with darker skin may have led to the prevalence of darker skin on the continent. The positive advantage, however, would have had to be strong enough so as to produce a significantly higher reproductive fitness in those who produced more melanin. The cause of a selective pressure strong enough to cause this shift is an area of much debate. Some hypotheses include the existence of significantly lower reproductive fitness in people with less melanin due to lethal skin cancer, lethal kidney disease due to excess [[vitamin D]] formation in the skin of people with less melanin, or simply natural selection due to mate preference and sexual selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalsocietypublishing.org&quot; /&gt;

When comparing the prevalence of albinism in Africa to its prevalence in other parts of the world, such as Europe and the United States, the potential evolutionary effects of skin cancer as a selective force due to its effect on these populations may not be insignificant.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalsocietypublishing.org&quot; /&gt; It would follow, then, that there would be stronger selective forces acting on albino populations in Africa than on albino populations in Europe and the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hong |first1=E. S. |last2=Zeeb |first2=H. |last3=Repacholi |first3=M. H. |title=Albinism in Africa as a public health issue |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=6 |pages=212 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-6-212 |pmid=16916463 |pmc=1584235 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two separate studies in Nigeria, people with albinism were found to be of reproductively significant age more often than not. One study found that 89% of people diagnosed with albinism are between 0 and 30 years of age, while the other found that 77% of albinos were under the age of 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;biomedcentral.com&quot; /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2007}}
[[Genetic testing]] can confirm albinism and what variety it is, but offers no medical benefits, except in the case of non-OCA disorders. Such disorders cause other medical problems in conjunction with albinism, and may be treatable. Genetic tests are currently available for parents who want to find out if they are carriers of ty-neg albinism. Diagnosis of albinism involves carefully examining a person's eyes, skin and hairs. Genealogical analysis can also help.

==Management==
Since there is no cure for albinism, it is managed through lifestyle adjustments. People with albinism need to take care not to get sunburnt and should have regular healthy skin checks by a dermatologist.

For the most part, treatment of the eye conditions consists of visual rehabilitation. Surgery is possible on the [[Extraocular muscles|extra-ocular muscles]] to decrease [[strabismus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot; /&gt; [[Nystagmus]]-damping surgery can also be performed, to reduce the &quot;shaking&quot; of the eyes back and forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Surgical management of nystagmus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=J. |title=Surgical management of nystagmus |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=238–41 |date=May 2002 |pmid=11983764 |pmc=1279676 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.5.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of all these procedures varies greatly and depends on individual circumstances.

[[Glasses]], low vision aids, [[large-print]] materials, and bright angled reading lights can help individuals with albinism. Some people with albinism do well using [[bifocals]] (with a strong reading lens), prescription reading glasses, hand-held devices such as [[Magnifying glass|magnifiers]] or [[monocular]]s or wearable devices like [[eSight]]
and [[Brainport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts Albinism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About Albinism |first1=Richard |last1=King |first2=C.

The condition may lead to abnormal development of the [[optic nerve]] and sunlight may damage the [[retina]] of the eye as the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] cannot filter out excess light due to a lack of pigmentation.

Newer designs of bioptics use smaller light-weight lenses. Some US states allow the use of bioptic telescopes for driving motor vehicles. (See also [[National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation|NOAH]] bulletin &quot;Low Vision Aids&quot;.)

There are a number of national support groups across the globe which come under the umbrella of the World Albinism Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anon |title=World Albinism Alliance |url=https://worldalbinism.org/2015/01/07/introduction-to-the-world-albinism-alliance/ |publisher=WAA |accessdate=27 July 2018|date=2015-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Albinism affects people of all ethnic backgrounds; its frequency worldwide is estimated to be approximately one in 17,000. Prevalence of the different forms of albinism varies considerably by population, and is highest overall in people of [[sub-Saharan]] African descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oculocutaneous albinism&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gronskov |first=K. |last2=Ek |first2=J. |last3=Brondum-Nielsen |first3=K. |title=Oculocutaneous albinism |journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases |date=2 November 2007 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-43 |pmc=2211462 |pmid=17980020 |volume=2 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the prevalence of albinism in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] is around 1 in 5,000, while in Europe and the US it is 1 in 20,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalsocietypublishing.org&quot; /&gt; Rates as high as 1 in 1,000 have been reported for some populations in Zimbabwe and other parts of [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biomedcentral.com&quot;/&gt;

Certain ethnic groups and populations in isolated areas exhibit heightened susceptibility to albinism, presumably due to genetic factors. These include notably the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]], [[Zuni people|Zuni]] and [[Hopi]] nations (respectively of [[Panama]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]]); [[Japan]], in which one particular form of albinism is unusually common; and [[Ukerewe Island]], the population of which shows a very high incidence of albinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.southern-africas-children.org.uk/ukerewe-albino.html |title=Ukerewe Albino Society |date=2009 |work=Southern Africas Children |access-date=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
In physical terms, humans with albinism commonly have visual problems and need sun protection.

===Persecution of people with albinism===
{{Main|Persecution of people with albinism}}
Humans with albinism often face social and cultural challenges (even threats), as the condition is often a source of ridicule, discrimination, or even fear and violence. It is especially socially stigmatised in many African societies. A study conducted in Nigeria on albino children stated that &quot;they experienced alienation, avoided social interactions and were less emotionally stable. Furthermore, affected individuals were less likely to complete schooling, find employment, and find partners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Magna |first1=P. |title=Biology and genetics of Oculocutaneous albinism and vitiligo-common pigmentation disorders in Southern Africa |journal=South African Medical Journal |date=January 2014 |volume=103 |issue=1| pmid=24300644 |pages=984–8 |url= http://www.ajol.info/index.php/samj/article/view/98355|doi=10.7196/samj.7046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures around the world have developed beliefs regarding people with albinism.

In African countries such as [[Tanzania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7518049.stm |title=Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos |work=[[BBC News]] |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=21 July 2008 |access-date=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Burundi]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11614957 |title=Burundi albino boy 'dismembered' |work=BBC News |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8057956.stm |title=Burundian albino murders denied |work=BBC News |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=19 May 2009 |access-date=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been an unprecedented rise in [[witchcraft]]-related killings of people with albinism in recent years, because their body parts are used in potions sold by [[witchdoctor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.visuramagazine.com/franck-vogel-zeru-zeru |first=Franck |last=Vogel |author-link=Franck Vogel |title=Zeru, Zeru: Being Albino in Tanzania |work=Visura Magazine |publisher=Foto Visura |location=Westford, Vermont |issue=10 |date=August 2010 |access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous authenticated incidents have occurred in Africa during the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7726743.stm |title=Man 'tried to sell' albino wife |work=BBC News |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 November 2008 |access-date=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/africa/7527729.stm |title=Tanzania albinos targeted again |work=BBC News |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 July 2008 |access-date=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ntetema |first=Vicky |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7523796.stm |title=In hiding for exposing Tanzania witchdoctors |work=BBC News |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=24 July 2008 |access-date=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7730193.stm |title=Mothers hacked in albino attacks |work=BBC News |date=14 November 2008 |access-date=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Tanzania, in September 2009, three men were convicted of killing a 14-year-old albino boy and severing his legs in order to sell them for witchcraft purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8270446.stm |title=Death for Tanzania albino killers |work=BBC News |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=23 September 2009 |access-date=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Again in Tanzania and Burundi in 2010, the murder and dismemberment of a kidnapped albino child was reported from the courts,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot; /&gt; as part of a continuing problem.  The US-based [[National Geographic Society]] estimated that in Tanzania a complete set of albino body parts is worth [[United States dollar|US$]]75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/01/130125-albino-albinism-tanzania-witch-doctors/ |title=Pictures: Inside the Lives of Albinos in Tanzania |first1=Sasha |last1=Ingber |first2=Jacquelyn |last2=Martin |work=National Geographic News |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |location=Washington DC |date=27 January 2013 |access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |title=Tanzanians with albinism targeted for witchcraft |date=30 April 2015 |publisher=[[UNICEF]] |via=YouTube |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocwWzE6_u20 |access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another harmful and false belief is that sex with an albinistic woman will cure a man of [[HIV]]. This has led, for example in [[Zimbabwe]], to rapes (and subsequent HIV infection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ipsnews.net/2002/11/rights-zimbabwe-the-last-minority-group-to-find-a-voice/ |title=The Last Minority Group to Find a Voice |last=Machipisa |first=Lewis |work=IPSNews.net |publisher=Inter Press Service News Agency |access-date=30 January 2010 |url-status = live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090121145742/http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=14122 |archive-date=21 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albinism in popular culture===
{{Main|Albinism in popular culture}}
Famous people with albinism include historical figures such as [[Oxford University|Oxford]] don [[William Archibald Spooner]]; actor-comedian [[Victor Varnado]]; musicians such as [[Johnny Winter|Johnny]] and [[Edgar Winter]], [[Salif Keita]], [[Yellowman|Winston &quot;Yellowman&quot; Foster]], [[Brother Ali]], [[Sivuca]], [[Hermeto Pascoal]], [[Piano Red|Willie &quot;Piano Red&quot; Perryman]], [[Kalash Criminel]]; and fashion models [[Connie Chiu]] and [[Shaun Ross (model)|Shaun Ross]].  [[Emperor Seinei]] of Japan is thought to have been an albino because he was said to have been born with white hair.&lt;!--

===International Albinism Awareness Day===
{{Main|International Albinism Awareness Day}}
[[International Albinism Awareness Day]] was established after a motion was accepted on 18 December 2014 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], proclaiming that as of 2015, 13 June would be known as International Albinism Awareness Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Albinism Awareness Day |url= https://www.un.org/en/events/albinismday/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by a mandate created by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] that appointed [[Ikponwosa Ero|Ms. Ikponwosa Ero]], who is from Nigeria, as the very first Independent Expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Independent Expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism |url= http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Albinism/Pages/IEAlbinism.aspx |work=OHCHR.org |publisher=[[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[United Nations]] |location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film career ==

Diab's fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, ''El Afareet'', which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film ''Ice Cream in Gleam'' (''Ays Krim fi Glym''), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's new program &quot;Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films&quot; at James Bridges Theater at UCLA on 6, 8 and  10 April 1999. David Chute of the ''Los Angeles Weekly'' termed it &quot;observant&quot; and &quot;a big leap&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= David |last= Chute |author2=Irene G. Behnan |title= All Singing!

'''Belgian hip hop music''' has a few [[rapper]]s stemming from [[Africa]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mtviggy.com/articles/artist-of-the-week-congolese-belgian-rapper-baloji/ |title=Artist of the Week: Congolese-Belgian Rapper Baloji! |publisher=Mtv Iggy |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgium]], like [[France]], controlled [[Africa]]n countries like the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly Zaire), [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]] until the early 1960s. Like in France, [[Immigration|immigrants]] from these countries started to study and live in [[Belgium]].

The Belgian [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene started in the late 1980s with a U.S.-based [[techno music|techno]]/hip hop group called [[Technotronic]]. In the group was an emcee named [[Ya Kid K]] from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] who later led the group into international fame with hits like &quot;Pump up the Jam&quot; and &quot;Shake That Body&quot;. In 1990, she also joined the group Hi-Tek 3 who were heard on ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]''.

However, in the original Belgian movement  the [[BRC Crew]] symbolise the real spirit of American underground Hip Hop culture with his singer [[Defi-J]] and also the first major pop rapper from Belgium was [[Benny B]], who had a very mainstream and commercial sound.  According to the European Music Office's report on ''Music in Europe'', this was the first of many pop acts that helped inspire a backlash and the creation of an underground hip hop scene.

Also in the late 1980s in the [[Wallonia|Walloon south]] of the country, French speaking/rapping [[Starflam]] was the biggest name in hip hop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Morgan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/04/baloji-rapper-congo-sorcerer-interview |title=Baloji: 'I want to make music that is very African and very modern' &amp;#124; Music &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Flanders|Flemish]] north Dutch speaking/rapping groups like [['t Hof van Commerce]], Krapoel In Axe, St Andries MC's, and ABN were popular, rapping in their regional [[dialect]]s.

In the year 2010 an authentic famous rapper [[James Deano]] make is come back with his binomial [[Olmo Carniselli]] AKA Mr Everybody after his succes song &quot;Les Blancs Ne Savent Pas Danser&quot; and innovate a new concept of Mr Everybody &quot;Les Freestyles De La semaine&quot; on YouTube.

Today, the Belgian hip hop scene is growing. Rappers like [[Coely]], [[Roméo Elvis]] and [[Damso]] are achieving commercial success in their country and abroad. Other contemporary rappers/formations are [[Stikstof]], [[Woodie Smalls]], [[L'Or Du Commun]] and [[Isha (hip hop)|Isha]].

'''Dutch hip hop''' or '''Nederhop''', is [[hip hop music]] created by musicians in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]].

==History==

===1980s===
Between 1980 and 1985 a few Dutch Hip Hop records had already been released, but in 1986 Dutch rap duo [[MC Miker G &amp; DJ Sven]] (Lucien Witteveen and Sven van Veen) had a major top 10 hit (often #1) across Europe with their &quot;Holiday Rap&quot;, which sampled [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] &quot;Holiday&quot;. That same year Dutch rapper [[Extince]] released his first record: Rap Around The Clock. Another 1980s group was the [[Osdorp Posse]], who first started to record tracks in Dutch. But there is disagreement about who started rapping in Dutch between Blonnie B, Alex and the CityCrew, Dynamic Rockers, Def Rhymes and Osdorp Posse.

Notable in the late 1980s were All Star Fresh of [[King Bee (hip hop group)|King Bee]] topping charts with: &quot;Back by Dope Demand&quot; in early 1990 and Rudeboy of [[Urban Dance Squad]] who, at the time, were arguably more widely known in New York City than the Netherlands. DJ and Producer All Star Fresh Started as a Pro in 1979. After winning the Dutch Mixing Championships (DMC) in 1988, he was invited for The World Mix Championships in the London Royal Hall and won third place in a fierce competition. He was invited by Dave Funkenklein to enter the lions hole in New York. He made history in the Big Apple of Hiphop by being the first non -American to fly into the finals of The World Supremacy Battle of DJs. He gained the highly respected second place of this prestigious DJ contest). The impression that he made that year, resulted in many invitations to perform with world known artists like Public Enemy, Stetsasonic, Ice T and Ultra Magnetic MCs.

All Star Fresh. As performer and producer he is very well known as KING BEE. With his second floor filler Back By Dope Demand he scored one of the biggest hiphop hits. In the Netherlands it resulted in a Top 3 position. Best Dance Product by The Edison Awards in the Netherlands. (The Edison Awards is an award by the Dutch Music Industry.) This also meant that with this title, he was the first black artist to win this award in the Netherlands. After that he appeared as supporting act for Madonnas show in the Netherlands. All Star Fresh kept entering the dance floors. The last titles mentioned were also worldwide hits, selling over 2.4&amp;nbsp;million copies. He didn't only work within projects like King Bee or Capella, but also was featuring famous production teams like Snap (I Got the Power). This teamwork resulted in the single Lets Get Busy (Clubland Quarts feat Snap {{sic|introductin}} King Bee). This record ended up No 01 in the Billboard Dance Charts (United States). Other productions were Deepzone &quot;It's Gonna Be All right&quot;, a straight up club anthem even until today. Kellee- my love, Ty Holden- you're my Inspiration and His Royal Freshness- They don't understand are a couple of other productions in this line.

Urban Dance Squad was a Dutch rap rock band formed after what was originally intended as a one-time jam-session at a festival in Utrecht on 20 December 1986[1]. Band members were rapper Rudeboy Remington (Patrick Tilon), guitarist Tres Manos (René van Barneveld), bassist Sil (Silvano Matadin), drummer Magic Stick (Michel Schoots) and DJ DNA (DoNotAsk) (Arjen de Vreede). The band's music is described as a blend of genres, including hard rock, funk, soul, hip hop, reggae, jazz and ska and is often compared to that of Rage Against the Machine, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone. They are widely known for their hit single &quot;Deeper Shade of Soul&quot;, which charted at number 21 in the United States on Billboard Hot 100. It is a well known fact that Rage Against the Machine was inspired by the Urban Dance Squad.

===1990s===
In 1992, Osdorp Posse released their debut album ''Osdorp Stijl'', which was the first-ever hip hop in Dutch language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keys|first1=Kelsea|title=Osdorp Posse's Biography|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Osdorp+Posse/+wiki|website=last.fm|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.They started out translating [[N.W.A]] songs to [[Dutch language|Dutch]], though later wrote their own rhymes in Dutch. Their beats, created by producer Seda on Amiga 500 with Protracker, have a familiar heavy sound and are similar to U.S. old-school hip hop. Frontman Def-P describes it as [[hardcore rap]].

After the first Osdorp Posse demo cassette they toured around the Netherlands. In Deventer they found the first followers and the first Dutch language hip hop scene. The first hip hop groups after Osdorp Posse were Zuid-Oost Posse and Maasstraat Mannen. These groups did concerts all over the Netherlands. Maasstraat became famous as the first group combining reggae with Dutch lyrics, inspiring acts like Postmen, for example.

Another Dutch-language rapper is Extince, who in 1995 took Nederhop to a new commercial level. With two of his singles ''Spraakwater'' and ''Kaal of Kammen'' being major hits in the mid-1990s, Extince was the first Dutch rapper making the MegaCharts. Other notable acts include Ali B (who has been featured on other artists' tracks, most significantly with Marco Borsato on the song &quot;Wat zou je doen?&quot; for the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] who achieved solo success with &quot;Leipe mocro flavour&quot;. Together with his cousin Yes-R he made an international remix of &quot;[[Ghetto (Akon song)|Ghetto]]&quot; together with Akon.; the duo Lange Frans &amp; Baas B with their patriotic but introspective &quot;[[Het land van (song)|Het Land Van]]&quot;; and [[Yes-R]]. Other notable groups are &quot;Opgezwolle&quot; (consisting of rapper Sticky Steez, rapper Phreaco Rico and DJ Delic) and Brainpower.

There were two styles dominating the Dutch hip hop landscape: [[Extince]], known for his easy flows, catchy songs and funky tunes, while hardcore performers like [[Westklan]] and [[Osdorp Posse]] found their own niche group of fans.

In the mid-1990s [[The Postmen]] were topping the charts with their rap/[[reggae]] mix.

===2000s===
In the early 2000s the MC fronted band [[Relax (band)|Relax]] got much airplay, as did de Spookrijders.

A combination of these two styles gave birth to de Spookrijders, a three-man hip-hop group founded in 1996. With MCs Stefan and Clyde rapping about their personal lives and life in Amsterdam as a black man, de Spookrijders even gained respect from non-hip-hop musicians and fans. Most people admired the work of producer/DJ Cliff 'the Jazz' Nille after releasing Spookrijders debut album ''De Echte Shit''. In 1999 de Spookrijders hit the charts twice with the hits &quot;Klokkenluiders&quot; and &quot;Ik ben de man.&quot; Both these songs appeared on the second album, ''Klokkenluiders van Amsterdam''. After some personal arguments among the three crewmembers, de Spookrijders split up in 2003, after releasing their and final third album ''Hee... Spookies!!''

Def Rhymz, Spookrijders &amp; Brainpower really helped develop the game. Def Rhymz &amp; Brainpower dropped multiple hit records. With at least 8 Top 100 album/EP projects Brainpower is one of the most successful Dutch MC's ever and remains a prolific bilingual lyricist (in Dutch &amp; in English) to this day.

[[Opgezwolle]], a group from [[Zwolle]]'s latest album, ''[[Eigen Wereld]]'' (Own World) appeared in the 'Album Top 100' at number 4; the highest notation of a Dutch rap album ever. [[Opgezwolle]] split up on 30 November 2007. Members Rico &amp; Sticks formed a new group, [[Fakkelbrigade]] with [[MC Typhoon]], [[Mick 2dope Murray]], [[MC James]] and beatmaker [[A.R.T. (musician)|ART]]. In 2009, they released the album ''[[Colucci Era]]''.

In the mid-2000s [[Cilvaringz]], [[Ali B]] and [[Raymzter]] have commercially been successful and [[Lange Frans &amp; Baas B]] have had multiple No. 1 hits. In 2005, [[De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig]] (&quot;Kids These Days&quot;) were successful with &quot;[[Watskeburt]]?!&quot; (&quot;Wuzhappenin?!&quot;).

Rapper [[Jawat]] won the &quot;[[Grote Prijs van Nederland]]&quot; 2006.

Another Dutch hip-hop duo are [[Pete Philly and Perquisite]] who are already well known in the Netherlands, Germany, and even in Japan.

A famous Dutch rapper outside the Netherlands is Salah Edin. His album [[Nederlands Grootste Nachtmerrie]] (Biggest Nightmare of the Netherlands) won Best Album Award in 2007 and was fully produced by Dr. Dre's right-hand man Focus. He also shot three of the most expensive music videos ever in the history of Dutch Hip Hop and through a management deal with [[Cilvaringz]], performed in 34 countries worldwide.

===2010s===
The year 2010 is considered an important year for Dutch hip-hop, with many albums and mixtapes released from the biggest Dutch rappers.

Also [[Mc Battles]] are having a large amount of popularity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Nederhop is growing fast. So are the recently Nederhop blogs as Nederhopofficial.nl and Puna.nl.

In 2016, album ''[[WOP!]]'' by [[Lil' Kleine]] was the first hip-hop album to reacher number 1 on the [[Album Top 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://3voor12.vpro.nl/artikelen/overzicht/2016/Februari/lil-kleine-wop-nummer-1-album-single-top-100.html|title=Lil' Kleine breekt records: heel WOP in de Single Top 100 – stories|work=[[3VOOR12]]|access-date=6 November 2017|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nu.nl/muziek/4217564/lil-kleine-breekt-meerdere-records-in-nederlandse-hitlijsten.html|title=Lil' Kleine breekt meerdere records in Nederlandse hitlijsten|work=[[NU.nl]]|access-date=6 November 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts===
The Dutch hip-hop scene also saw many conflicts between rappers, followed by diss tracks. The following were among the biggest Dutch feuds in hip-hop:

[Osdorp Posse] Vs [Extince], [Brain Power] Vs [Extince], [[T.H.C]] . Vs [[Negativ]], [[Kempi]] Vs [[Nino (rapper)|Nino]], [[Brainpower]] Vs [[Extince]], Yukkie B Vs Negativ, T.H.C. Vs Lexxxus, Baas B Vs Kimo, Kempi Vs Mini, Kempi Vs Bloedserieus, Heist Rockah Vs Negativ, and Regga Vs Lexxxus.

The feud between T.H.C. and Lexxxus resulted in a fistfight on a hip-hop event, when T.H.C. frontman rocks got into an argument with Lexxxus and then started the fistfight.

== Genres in Dutch hip hop ==

===Gangsta===
Dutch gangsta hip hop is currently a large scene together with underground hip-hop. Among the most notable groups are [[Tuindorp Hustler Click|THC]], [[Heinek'n]], [[Keizer (rapper)|Keizer]], [[Kempi]], Steen, Hef, Crooks, [[Adonis (rapper)|Adonis]] and [[Negativ]]. The rhythms are influenced by the American rap scene, and the [[lyrics]] are often about crime, [[drugs]], money, women and other criminal things.
Often coming from Dutch [[ghetto]]s, lyrics often include themes occurring in these areas.
Dutch gangsta hip hop mostly comes from the five largest  cities: [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Den Haag]], [[Utrecht]] and [[Eindhoven]].

===Commercial success===
The commercial success of Dutch hip hop is largely made by [[Brainpower]], [[Yes-R]], [[Ali B]], [[Lange Frans &amp; Baas B]] and [[Extince]]. For a large part of the Dutch hip hop community Yes-R, Ali B and Lange Frans &amp; Baas B are sometimes considered fake because they do a lot of work for children TV stations. [[Brainpower]] and [[Extince]] however both enjoy a great respect for bringing up hip hop in their native [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Other commercial rappers are [[De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig]], and one of the more popular artists in the Netherlands, Partysquad or The Partysquad. They are a 2-man group, having had success with hits such as &quot;Stuk&quot; (Broken), and &quot;Dat is Die Shit&quot; (That's the shit), with other popular songs in the background such as &quot;Non Stop&quot; ft. [[Brainpower]], &quot;We Gaan Los&quot; (we're going crazy {because of highness or drunkenness}) with Kempi, and &quot;Wat Wil Je Doen&quot; (What do you want to do?).

===Dutch oldskool===
The Dutch [[Old school hip hop|oldskool]] exists out of three primary artists, [[LTH (musician)|LTH]], [[Osdorp Posse]], [[Extince]], [[Sugacane]] and [[Duvelduvel]]. [[Osdorp Posse]] make to what they themselves call hardcore rap and use beats that have much in common with [[N.W.A]]. Their lyrics are about racism, prostitution (not always negatively), police and other social subjects. Extince uses very different, more funky kind of beats than Osdorp Posse and uses a completely different rapstyle. Duvelduvel is known as a conceptual hip hop group.

'''Angela Anaïs Juana Antolina Rosa Edelmira Nin y Culmell''' (February 21, 1903 – January 14, 1977), known professionally as '''Anaïs Nin''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ə|.|iː|s|_|n|iː|n|}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Lives: An Anthology of Autobiographical Writing|page=597|editor=Sayre, Robert F.|year=1994|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn= 978-0-299-14244-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ana.is nin|lang}}) was a [[French people|French]]-[[Cuban people|Cuban]] American diarist, essayist, novelist, and writer of short stories and [[erotica]]. Born to Cuban parents in [[France]], Nin was the daughter of composer [[Joaquín Nin]] and Rosa Culmell, a classically trained singer. Nin spent her early years in  Spain and Cuba, about sixteen years in [[Paris]] (1924–1940), and the remaining half of her life in the United States, where she became an established author.

Beginning at age eleven, Nin wrote [[diary|journal]]s prolifically for six decades and even up until her death. Her journals, many of which were published during her lifetime, detail her private thoughts and personal relationships. Her journals also describe her marriage to [[Hugh Parker Guiler]] and marriage to [[Rupert Pole]], in addition to her numerous affairs, including those with psychoanalyst [[Otto Rank]] and writer [[Henry Miller]], both of whom profoundly influenced Nin and her writing.

In addition to her journals, Nin wrote several novels, critical studies, essays, short stories, and volumes of [[erotic literature|erotica]]. Much of her work, including the collections of erotica ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' and ''[[Little Birds]]'', was published posthumously amid renewed critical interest in her life and work. Nin spent her later life in [[Los Angeles]], California, where she died of cervical cancer in 1977.

==Early life==
Anaïs Nin was born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]], France, to [[Joaquín Nin]], a Cuban pianist and composer of [[Catalans|Catalan]] Spanish descent, and Rosa Culmell,&lt;ref name=&quot;kir&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/anaisnin.htm |title=Anaïs Nin profile|website=kirjasto.sci.fi|first=Petri|last=Liukkonen|publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library|location=Finland |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20120123084641/http%3A//www%2Ekirjasto%2Esci%2Efi/anaisnin%2Ehtm|archivedate= 23 January 2012|url-status=dead|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; a classically trained Cuban singer of French descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morbidoutlook.com/nonfiction/articles/2001_03_anaisnin.html|title= The Unique Anaïs Nin|author=Fenner, Andrew|accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's grandfather had fled France during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], going first to [[Saint-Domingue]], then [[New Orleans]], and finally to [[Cuba]] where he helped build that country's first railway.{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=125}}

Nin was raised a [[Roman Catholic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Spy In The House Of Love (Foreword)|author=Stuhlmann, Gunther|page=3|publisher=Swallow Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the church when she was 16 years old.{{sfn|Nin|DuBow|1994|p=126}} She spent her childhood and early life in Europe. Her  parents separated when she was two; her mother then moved Anaïs and her two brothers, Thorvald Nin and [[Joaquín Nin-Culmell]], to [[Barcelona]], and then to New York City, where she attended high school. Nin would drop out of high school in 1919 at age sixteen,{{sfn|Nin|DuBow|1994|p=xxi}} and according to her diaries, ''Volume One, 1931–1934'', later began working as an artist's model. After being in the United States for several years, Nin had forgotten how to speak Spanish, but retained her French and became fluent in English.{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=183}}

On March 3, 1923, in [[Havana]], Cuba, Nin married her first husband, [[Hugh Parker Guiler]] (1898–1985), a banker and artist, later known as &quot;Ian Hugo&quot; when he became a maker of [[experimental film]]s in the late 1940s. The couple moved to Paris the following year, where Guiler pursued his banking career and Nin began to pursue her interest in writing; in her diaries she also mentions having trained as a [[flamenco]] dancer in Paris in the mid-to-late 1920s with [[Francisco Miralles Arnau]]. Her first published work was a critical evaluation of [[D. H. Lawrence]] called ''[[D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study]]'', which she wrote in sixteen days.&lt;ref name=&quot;kir&quot;/&gt;

Nin became profoundly interested in [[psychoanalysis]] and would study it extensively, first with [[René Allendy]] in 1932 and then with [[Otto Rank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Writers|author=Oakes, Elizabeth H.|page=255|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1-438-10809-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men eventually became her lovers, as she recounts in her ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;Anais Nin, ''Journal (1931-1934)'', Paris: Le Livre de Poche, 1966, pp. 138, 171–172, 237, 404, 505, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; On her second visit to Rank, Nin reflects on her desire to be &quot;re-born&quot; as a woman and artist. Rank, she observes, helped her move back and forth between what she could verbalize in her journals and what remained unarticulated. She discovered the quality and depth of her feelings in the wordless transitions between what she could say and what she could not say.  &quot;As he talked, I thought of my difficulties with writing, my struggles to articulate feelings not easily expressed. Of my struggles to find a language for intuition, feeling, instincts which are, in themselves, elusive, subtle, and wordless.&quot;{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=276}}

In the late summer of 1939, when residents from overseas were urged to leave France due to the approaching [[Second World War|war]], Nin left Paris and returned to New York City with her husband. (Guiler was, according to his own wishes, edited out of the diaries published during Nin's lifetime; his role in her life is therefore difficult to gauge.)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Several persons, when faced with the question of whether they wanted to remain in the diary 'as is' ... chose to be deleted altogether from the manuscript (including her husband and some members of her family).&quot; ''The Diary of Anaïs Nin'', ed. by Gunther Stuhlmann. Harcourt, 1966, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Nin sent her books to Frances Steloff of the [[Gotham Book Mart]] in New York for safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anaisnin.com/history/Steloff.html |title=Frances Steloff |publisher=AnaisNin.com |date= |accessdate=October 2, 2017|author=Griffin, M. Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, Anaïs rejoined Otto Rank, who had previously moved there, and moved into his apartment. She actually began to act as a psychoanalyst herself, seeing patients in the room next to Rank's, and having sex with her patients on the psychoanalytic couch.{{sfn|Nin|1967|pages=17–25}} She quit after several months, however, stating: &quot;I found that I wasn't good because I wasn't objective. I was haunted by my patients. I wanted to intercede.&quot;&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;  It was in New York that she met the Japanese-American modernist photographer [[Soichi Sunami]], who went on to photograph her for many of her books.

==Literary career==
===Journals===
Nin's most studied works are her diaries or journals, which she began writing in her adolescence. The published journals, which span several decades from 1933 onward, provide a deeply explorative insight into her personal life and relationships. Nin was acquainted, often quite intimately, with a number of prominent authors, artists, [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]], and other figures, and wrote of them often, especially Otto Rank. Moreover, as a female author describing a primarily masculine constellation of celebrities, Nin's journals have acquired importance as a counterbalancing perspective.

In the third volume of her unexpurgated journal, ''Incest'', she wrote about her father candidly and graphically (207–15), detailing his sexual abuse of her at age nine.

Previously unpublished works are coming to light in ''A Café in Space, the Anaïs Nin Literary Journal'', which includes &quot;Anaïs Nin and Joaquín Nin y Castellanos: Prelude to a Symphony—Letters between a father and daughter&quot;.

So far sixteen volumes of her journals have been published.  All but the last five of her adult journals are in expurgated form.

===Erotic writings===
Nin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest writers of [[Women's erotica|female erotica]]. She was one of the first women known to explore fully the realm of erotic writing, and certainly the first prominent woman in the modern West known to write erotica. Before her, erotica acknowledged to be written by women was rare, with a few notable exceptions, such as the work of [[Kate Chopin]]. Nin often cited authors [[Djuna Barnes]] and D. H. Lawrence as inspirations, and she states in ''Volume One'' of her diaries that she drew inspiration from [[Marcel Proust]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=15}} [[André Gide]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=45}} [[Jean Cocteau]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|pages=60, 109}} [[Paul Valéry]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=60}} and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=29, 40}}

According to ''Volume One'' of her diaries, ''1931–1934'', published in 1966, Nin first came across erotica when she returned to Paris with her husband, mother and two brothers in her late teens. They rented the apartment of an American man who was away for the summer, and Nin came across a number of French paperbacks: &quot;One by one, I read these books, which were completely new to me.  I had never read erotic literature in America... They overwhelmed me.  I was innocent before I read them, but by the time I had read them all, there was nothing I did not know about sexual exploits... I had my degree in erotic lore.&quot;{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=96}}

Faced with a desperate need for money, Nin, Henry Miller and some of their friends began in the 1940s to write erotic and pornographic narratives for an anonymous &quot;collector&quot; for a dollar a page, somewhat as a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gertzman, Jay A.|page=344|title=Bookleggers and Smuthounds: The Trade in Erotica, 1920-1940|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2011|edition=Reprint|isbn=978-0-812-20585-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is not clear whether Miller actually wrote these stories or merely allowed his name to be used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noël Riley Fitch]], ''Anaïs: The Erotic Life of Anaïs Nin'' (Boston: [[Little, Brown and Company]], 1993) {{ISBN|0-316-28428-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Nin considered the characters in her erotica to be extreme caricatures and never intended the work to be published, but changed her mind in the early 1970s and allowed them to be published as ''[[Delta of Venus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowaleski-Wallace|first=Elizabeth|title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Literary Theory|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0053unse/page/190 190]|isbn=978-0-8153-0824-9|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0053unse/page/190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Gibson|title=Postmodernity, Ethics and the Novel: From Leavis to Levinas|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-19895-0|p=[https://archive.org/details/postmodernityeth00gibs_0/page/177 177]|url=https://archive.org/details/postmodernityeth00gibs_0/page/177}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Little Birds]]''. In 2016, a previously-undiscovered collection of erotica, ''Auletris'', was published for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Psychology Today|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-empowerment-diary/201611/the-sexual-censorship-controversy|date=November 3, 2016|author=Raab, Diana|title=The Sexual Censorship Controversy|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nin was a friend, and in some cases lover, of many literary figures, including Henry Miller, [[John Steinbeck]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[James Agee]], [[James Leo Herlihy]], and [[Lawrence Durrell]]. Her passionate love affair and friendship with Miller strongly influenced her both sexually and as an author. Claims that Nin was [[bisexual]] were given added circulation by the [[Philip Kaufman]] film ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' about Henry Miller and his second wife [[June Miller]]. The first unexpurgated portion of Nin's journal to be published, ''[[Henry and June]]'', makes it clear that Nin was stirred by June to the point of saying (paraphrasing), &quot;I have become June,&quot; though it is unclear whether she consummated her feelings for her sexually. To both Anaïs and Henry, June was a femme fatale—irresistible, cunning, erotic. Nin gave June money, jewelry, clothes, often leaving herself broke.

===Novels and other publications===
In addition to her journals and collections of erotica, Nin wrote several novels, which were frequently associated by critics with [[Surrealism#Surrealist literature|surrealism]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anais-Nin|title=Anaïs Nin|author= The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first book of fiction, ''[[House of Incest]]'' (1936), contains heavily veiled allusions to a brief sexual relationship Nin had with her father in 1933: While visiting her estranged father in France, the then-thirty-year-old Nin had a brief incestuous sexual relationship with him.&lt;ref name=father&gt;{{cite journal|author=Charnock, Ruth|date=September 30, 2013|title= Incest in the 1990s: Reading Anaïs Nin's 'Father Story'|journal=Life Writing|volume = 11|pages=55–68|doi=10.1080/14484528.2013.838732|url=http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/11712/1/Life%20Writing%20article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, she published a collection of short stories titled ''[[Under a Glass Bell]]'', which were reviewed by [[Edmund Wilson]].&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

Nin was also the author of several works of non-fiction: Her first publication, written during her years studying psychoanalysis, was ''[[D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study]]'' (1932), an assessment of the works of [[D.H. Lawrence]].{{sfn|Franklin|1996|p=6}} In 1968, she published ''[[The Novel of the Future]]'', which elaborated on her approach to writing and the writing process.{{sfn|Franklin|1996|p=127}}

==Personal life==
According to her diaries, ''Vol.1, 1931–1934'', Nin shared a [[bohemian style|bohemian]] lifestyle with Henry Miller during her time in Paris. Her husband Guiler is not mentioned anywhere in the published edition of the 1930s parts of her diary (Vol. 1–2) although the opening of Vol. 1 makes it clear that she is married, and the introduction suggests her husband refused to be included in the published diaries. The diaries edited by her second husband, after her death, tell that her union with Henry Miller was very passionate and physical, and that she believed that it was a pregnancy by him that she aborted in 1934.

In 1947, at the age of 44, she met former actor [[Rupert Pole]] in a Manhattan elevator on her way to a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/magazine/31pole.t.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=The Lover Who Always Stays|date=2006-12-31|accessdate=2011-02-16|author=Corbett, Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5591676|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|title=Anais Nin Husband, Rupert Pole, Dies in L.A.|date=July 29, 2006|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two ended up dating and traveled to California together; Pole was sixteen years her junior. On March 17, 1955, while still married to Guiler, she married Pole at [[Quartzsite, Arizona]], returning with him to live in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/26/local/me-pole26|date=July 26, 2006|title=The Ranger Who Told All About Anais Nin's Wild Life|author=Woo, Elaine|accessdate=October 4, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guiler remained in New York City and was unaware of Nin's second marriage until after her death in 1977, though biographer [[Deirdre Bair]] alleges that Guiler knew what was happening while Nin was in California, but consciously &quot;chose not to know&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot; /&gt;

Nin referred to her simultaneous marriages as her &quot;bicoastal trapeze&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot; /&gt; According to Deidre Bair:

{{quote|[Anaïs] would set up these elaborate façades in Los Angeles and in New York, but it became so complicated that she had to create something she called the lie box. She had this absolutely enormous purse and in the purse she had two sets of checkbooks. One said Anaïs Guiler for New York and another said Anaïs Pole for Los Angeles. She had prescription bottles from California doctors and New York doctors with the two different names. And she had a collection of file cards. And she said, &quot;I tell so many lies I have to write them down and keep them in the lie box so I can keep them straight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot; /&gt;}}

In 1966, Nin had her marriage with Pole annulled, due to the legal issues arising from both Guiler and Pole trying to claim her as a dependent on their federal tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2006/07/27/rupert_pole_executor_of_exotic_works_by_anas_nin/|work=Boston Globe|title=Rupert Pole, executor of exotic works by Anaïs Nin|author=Woo, Elaine|date=2006-07-27|accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the marriage was annulled, Nin and Pole continued to live together as if they were married, up until her death in 1977.  According to Barbara Kraft, prior to her death Anaïs had written to Hugh Guiler asking for his forgiveness.  He responded by writing how meaningful his life had been because of her.&lt;ref&gt;Kraft, Barbara. ''Anaïs Nin:  The Last Days'' Pegasus Books, {{ISBN|978-0-9889687-5-2}}, 2013, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

After Guiler's death in 1985, the [[expurgation|unexpurgated]] versions of her journals were commissioned by Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woo|first=Elaine|title=The Ranger Who Told All About Anais Nin's Wild Life|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/26/local/me-pole26|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six volumes have appeared (''[[Henry and June]]'', ''[[Fire: From a Journal of Love|Fire]]'', ''[[Incest: From a Journal of Love|Incest]]'', ''[[Nearer the Moon]]'', ''[[Mirages: The Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin, 1939-1947|Mirages]]'', and ''[[Trapeze: The Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin, 1947–1955|Trapeze]]''). Pole arranged for Guiler's ashes to be scattered in the same area where Anaïs's ashes were scattered, a place called Mermaid Cove off the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5591676&amp;t=1575988142161&lt;/ref&gt; Pole died in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The New York Times|date=July 30, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/us/30pole.html|accessdate=October 6, 2017|title=Rupert Pole, 87, Diarist's Duplicate Spouse, Dies|author=Fox, Margalit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nin once worked at Lawrence R. Maxwell Books, located at [[45 Christopher Street]] in New York City.{{sfn|Franklin|1996|p=6}} In addition to her work as a writer,  Nin appeared in the [[Kenneth Anger]] film ''[[Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome]]'' (1954) as [[Astarte]]; in the [[Maya Deren]] film ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' (1946); and in ''Bells of Atlantis'' (1952), a film directed by Guiler under the name &quot;Ian Hugo&quot; with a soundtrack of [[electronic music]] by [[Louis and Bebe Barron]].{{sfn|Nin|DuBow|1994|pages=xxi–ii}} In her later life, Nin worked as a tutor at the [[International College, Los Angeles|International College]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=kraft/&gt;

==Death==
Nin was diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] in 1974.{{sfn|Herron|1996|p=235}} She battled the cancer for several years as it metastasized, and underwent numerous surgeries, [[Radiation therapy|radiation]], and [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref name=kraft&gt;{{cite web|work=Cultural Weekly|date=December 13, 2016|url=https://www.culturalweekly.com/anais-nin-last-days/|author=Kraft, Barbara|title=Anaïs Nin: The Last Days|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nin died of the cancer at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], California on January 14, 1977.&lt;ref name=herron&gt;{{cite book|title=Anaïs Nin: A Book of Mirrors|author=Herron, Paul|publisher=Sky Blue Press|year=1996|p=235|isbn= 978-0-965-23640-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nin, Anaïs.

Her first husband, Hugh Guiler, died in 1985, and his ashes were scattered in the cove as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot; /&gt; Rupert Pole was named Nin's [[literary executor]], and he arranged to have new, unexpurgated editions of Nin's books and diaries published between 1985 and his death in 2006.

==Legacy==
[[File:Anais Nin.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Anaïs Nin in the 1970s by [[Elsa Dorfman]]]]
The explosion of the [[feminist movement]] in the 1960s gave feminist perspectives on Nin's writings of the past twenty years, which made Nin a popular lecturer at various universities; contrarily, Nin disassociated herself from the political activism of the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;kir&quot; /&gt; In 1973, prior to her death, Nin received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the [[Philadelphia College of Art]]. She was also elected to the United States [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1974, and in 1976 was presented with a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Woman of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2011/06/times-woman-of-the-year-anais-nin.html|title=Times Woman of the Year – Anais Nin|date=June 6, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Kaufman]] directed the 1990 film ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' based on Nin's diaries published as ''[[Henry and June|Henry and June: From the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin]]''. She was portrayed in the film by actress [[Maria de Medeiros]].

In February 2008, poet [[Steven Reigns]] organized ''Anaïs Nin at 105'' at the Hammer Museum in Westwood, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=LA Weekly|title=All About Anais Nin|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/all-about-anais-nin-2151862|author=Kosnett, Rena|date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reigns said: &quot;Nin bonded and formed very deep friendships with women and men decades younger than her.

Cuban-American writer [[Daína Chaviano]] paid homage to Anaïs Nin and [[Henry Miller]] in her novel ''Gata encerrada'' (2001), where both characters are portraited as disembodied spirits whose previous lives they shared with Melisa, the main character—and presumably Chaviano's [[alter ego]]--, a young Cuban obsessed with Anaïs Nin.&lt;ref name=&quot;gata&quot;&gt;Rodríguez, Antonio O. and Andricaín, Sergio. &quot;Fusión de erotismo y magia: ''Gata encerrada'' es una novela cautivadora&quot;. [[Newsweek]] en Español, July 11, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;   
    
The Cuban poet and novelist [[Wendy Guerra]], long fascinated with Nin's life and works, published a fictional diary in Nin's voice, ''Posar desnuda en la Habana'' (''Posing Nude in Havana'') in 2012. She explained that &quot;[Nin's] Cuban Diary has very few pages and my delirium was always to write an apocryphal novel; literary conjecture about what might have happened&quot;.&lt;ref name=sanchez&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanchez| first1=Yoani| title=Cuban Author Wendy Guerra: 'I'm a Demon Who Writes What She Feels'| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/yoani-sanchez/cuban-author-wendy-guerra_b_6299348.html|accessdate=30 May 2016|publisher=HuffPost Latino Voices|date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 2013, screenwriter and author [[Kim Krizan]] published an article in ''[[The Huffington Post]]''&lt;ref name=gore/&gt; revealing she had found a previously unpublished love letter written by [[Gore Vidal]] to Nin. This letter contradicts Gore Vidal's previous characterization of his relationship with Nin, showing that Vidal did have feelings for Nin that he later heavily disavowed in his autobiography, ''Palimpsest''. Krizan did this research in the run up to the release of the fifth volume of Anaïs Nin's uncensored diary, ''Mirages'', for which Krizan provided the foreword.&lt;ref name=gore&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-krizan/gore-vidals-secret-unpubl_b_4004916.html|title=Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter To Anaïs Nin|date=September 27, 2013|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AIM''' ('''AOL Instant Messenger''') was an [[instant messaging]] and [[presence information|presence]] [[computer program]] created by [[AOL]], which used the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[OSCAR protocol|OSCAR instant messaging protocol]] and the [[TOC protocol]] to allow registered users to communicate in real time.

AIM was popular from the late 1990s to the late 2000s in North America, and was the leading instant messaging application in that region. AIM's popularity declined steeply in the early 2010s as Internet social networks like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] gained popularity, and its fall has often been compared with other once-popular Internet services such as [[Myspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/15/aim-history/|title=The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted | first=Jason | last=Abbruzzese|work=mashable.com|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, AOL was acquired by [[Verizon Communications]].&lt;ref name=&quot;buyout-cnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Imbert|first1=Fred|title=Verizon to buy AOL for $4.4B; AOL shares soar|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102670331|publisher=CNBC|access-date=May 12, 2015|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sawers |first=Paul |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-4-4b-acquisition-of-aol/ |title=Verizon completes $4.4B acquisition of AOL |work=VentureBeat |date=June 23, 2015 |access-date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, Verizon combined AOL and Yahoo into its subsidiary Oath Inc (now called [[Verizon Media]]). The company discontinued AIM as a service on December 15, 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;retirement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aimemories.tumblr.com/|title=Our Yellow Running Man is Ready to Retire|last=Albers|first=Michael|work=AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) on Tumblr|publisher=[[Oath Inc.]]|access-date=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
AOL Instant Messenger was initially integrated into [[AOL#AOL Desktop|AOL Desktop]] and later also released as a stand-alone download by [[AOL|America Online]] (AOL) in May 1997 for [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mashable&quot;&gt;Abbruzzese, Jason. [http://mashable.com/2014/04/15/aim-history/ &quot;The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted&quot;]. [[Mashable]].com. 2014-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt; AIM was an outgrowth of &quot;online messages&quot; in the original platform written in PL/1 on a Stratus computer by Dave Brown. The software, maintained by AOL, Inc., at one time had the largest share of the instant messaging market in North America, especially in the United States (with 52% of the total reported {{as of|2006|lc=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigblueball.com/forums/general-other-im-news/34413-im-market-share.html |title=IM Market Share&amp;nbsp;— BigBlueBall Forums |publisher=Bigblueball.com |date= |access-date=December 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030030304/http://www.bigblueball.com/forums/general-other-im-news/34413-im-market-share.html |archivedate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include other instant messaging software related to or developed by AOL, such as [[ICQ]] and [[iChat]].

[[File:AIM 4.7 screenshot.png|thumb|AIM version 4.7 (released 2001)]]
Its main competitors during its heyday were [[ICQ]] (although AOL acquired it in 1998), [[Yahoo! Messenger]] and [[Windows Live Messenger|MSN Messenger]]. AOL particularly had a rivalry or &quot;chat war&quot; with rival [[Microsoft]] starting in 1999. There were several attempts from Microsoft to simultaneously log into their own and AIM's protocol servers. AOL were not happy about this and started blocking MSN Messenger from being able to access AIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/21/5635488/msn-messenger-vs-aol-aim-chat-wars|title=Inside Microsoft's '90s chat war with AOL|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=April 21, 2014|work=theverge.com|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-19/essays/chat-wars/|title=Chat Wars|date=March 25, 2014|work=nplusonemag.com|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AIM 6.8 screenshot.png|thumb|AIM version 6.8 (released 2008)]]
Official mobile versions of AIM appeared as early as 2001 on [[Palm OS]] through the AOL application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1020672/m105.html|title=Palm introduces new m105 PDA|author=|date=March 6, 2001|website=Macworld|access-date=April 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party applications allowed it to be used in 2002 for the [[Danger Hiptop|Sidekick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bgr.com/2007/10/02/mobile-im-clients-sidekick-helio-ocean-blackberry-iphone-and-more/|title=Mobile IM clients: Sidekick, Helio Ocean, BlackBerry, iPhone, and more|first=Jonathan S.|last=Geller|date=October 2, 2007|work=bgr.com|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version for [[Symbian OS]] was announced in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/aol-and-symbian-cosy-up/|title=AOL and Symbian cosy up|first=Ben|last=Charny|date=|website=ZDNet|access-date=April 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others for [[BlackBerry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/04/11/get-your-official-blackberry-im-clients-now-if-you-dare/|title=Get your official BlackBerry IM clients now, if you dare|author=|date=|website=Engadget|access-date=April 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Mobile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/aims-windows-mobile-chat-app-nails-a-bullseye/|title=AIM's Windows Mobile chat app nails a bullseye&amp;nbsp;— The Download Blog&amp;nbsp;— CNET Download.com|work=cnet.com|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2012, stand-alone official AIM client software includes advertisements and was available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[Classic Mac OS]], [[macOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[BlackBerry OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://products.aim.com/products |title=Products AIM |publisher=Products AIM |date= |access-date=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage decline and product sunset===
Around 2011, AIM started to lose popularity rapidly, partly due to the quick rise of [[Gmail]] and its built-in real-time [[Google Talk|Google Chat]] instant messenger integration in 2011 and because many people started purely moving onto [[SMS]] [[text messaging]] and later [[Social networking service|social networking]] Web sites for instant messaging, in particular, [[Facebook Messenger]], which was released as a standalone application the same year.

As of June 2011, one source reported AOL Instant Messenger market share had collapsed to 0.73%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opswat.com/sites/default/files/OPSWAT-Market-Share-Report-June-2011.pdf|title=OPSWAT Market Share Report June 2011|publisher=opswat.com|date=|access-date=August 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102180321/http://www.opswat.com/sites/default/files/OPSWAT-Market-Share-Report-June-2011.pdf|archive-date=January 2, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this number only reflects installed IM applications, and not active users. The engineers responsible for AIM claimed that they were unable to convince AOL management that free was the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted|url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/15/aim-history/|website=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2012, AOL ended employment of AIM's development staff while leaving it active and with help support still provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5893031/aim-is-unofficially-dead|title=AIM Is (Unofficially) Dead (Updated)|first=Sam|last=Biddle|work=gizmodo.com|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 2017, it was announced that the AIM service would be discontinued on December 15;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.aol.com/articles/aim-discontinued|title=AIM Sunset|work=AOL Help Article|access-date=October 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006155404/https://help.aol.com/articles/aim-discontinued|archive-date=October 6, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;retirement&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/10/06/rip-aim-aol-instant-messenger-dies-december/739076001/|title=RIP AIM: AOL Instant Messenger dies in December|first=Brett|last=Molina|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 6, 2017|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, a non-profit development team known as Wildman Productions started up a server for older versions of AOL Instant Messenger known as AIM Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/06/26/aols-instant-messenger-back-aim-phoenix/736383002/|title=AOL's instant messenger is back: Meet AIM Phoenix|first=Dalvin|last=Brown|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The &quot;Running Man&quot;==
[[File:Farm-Fresh aol messenger.png|thumb|left|The &quot;Running Man&quot;]]
The AIM mascot was designed by JoRoan Lazaro and was implemented in the first release in 1997. This was a yellow [[stick figure|stickman]]-like figure, often called the &quot;Running Man&quot;. The mascot appeared on all AIM logos and most wordmarks, and always appeared at the top of the buddy list. AIM's popularity in the late 1990s and the 2000s led to the &quot;Running Man&quot; becoming a familiar brand on the Internet. After over 14 years, the iconic logo finally disappeared as part of the AIM rebranding in 2011. However, in August 2013, the &quot;Running Man&quot; once again returned.&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/12/the-story-behind-aols-iconic-yellow-running-man/383652/|title=The Story Behind AOL's Iconic Yellow Running Man|first=Adrienne|last=LaFrance|work=theatlantic.com|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' editor called it a &quot;symbol of America&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/style/2014/12/aol-designer-explains-the-companys-iconic-yellow-running-man-logo|title=AOL Designer Explains the Company's Iconic Yellow Running Man Logo|work=complex.com|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015 the Running Man was officially featured in the [[London Marathon|Virgin London Marathon]], dressed by a person for the AOL-partnered [[WE Charity|Free The Children]] charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advertising.aol.co.uk/2015/03/31/aol-s-running-man-takes-part-in-london-marathon-in-support-of-fr/|title=AOL's Running Man takes part in London Marathon in Support of Free The Children|work=aol.co.uk|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol==
The standard protocol that AIM clients used to communicate is called [[OSCAR protocol|Open System for CommunicAtion in Realtime]] (OSCAR). Most AOL-produced versions of AIM and popular third party AIM clients use this protocol. However, AOL also created a simpler protocol called [[TOC protocol|TOC]] that lacks many of OSCAR's features, but was sometimes used for clients that only require basic chat functionality. The TOC/TOC2 protocol specifications were made available by AOL, while OSCAR is a closed protocol that third parties have had to reverse-engineer.

In January 2008, AOL introduced experimental [[XMPP|Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol]] (XMPP) support for AIM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://florianjensen.com/2008/01/17/aol-adopting-xmpp-aka-jabber/|title=AOL adopting XMPP aka Jabber|date=2008-01-17|access-date=2008-01-17|author=Florian Jensen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120143857/http://florianjensen.com/2008/01/17/aol-adopting-xmpp-aka-jabber/|archivedate=January 20, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing AIM users to communicate using the standardized, open-source XMPP. However, in March 2008, this service was discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} In May 2011, AOL started offering limited XMPP support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.com/xmpp |title=AOL XMPP Gateway |date=2011-05-14 |access-date=2011-05-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522092331/http://www.aim.com/xmpp |archivedate=May 22, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 2017, AOL announced (via XMPP-login-time messages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pidgin.im/pipermail/support/2017-March/029513.html|title=Fwd: AOL|date=2017-03-01|access-date=March 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302030248/https://pidgin.im/pipermail/support/2017-March/029513.html|archive-date=March 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that the AOL XMPP gateway would be desupported, effective March 28, 2017.

==Privacy==
For privacy regulations, AIM had strict age restrictions. AIM accounts are available only for people over the age of 13; children younger than that were not permitted access to AIM.&lt;ref name=&quot;6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://im.about.com/od/promotingimsafety/a/aim-privacy.htm|title=AIM Privacy -- Terms of Service Policy -- AIM Privacy|author=Brandon De Hoyos|work=About.com Tech|access-date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the AIM Privacy Policy, AOL had no rights to read or monitor any private communications between users. The profile of the user had no privacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy&quot; /&gt;

In November 2002, AOL targeted the corporate industry with Enterprise AIM Services (EAS), a higher security version of AIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2578769/aol-takes-aim-at-corporate-instant-messaging-users.html|title=AOL Takes AIM at Corporate Instant Messaging Users|first=Todd R.|last=Weiss|date=November 11, 2002|website=Computerworld|access-date=April 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If public content was accessed, it could be used for online, print or broadcast advertising, etc. This was outlined in the policy and terms of service: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;you grant AOL, its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, assigns, agents and licensees the irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to reproduce, display, perform, distribute, adapt and promote this Content in any medium&quot;. This allowed anything users posted to be used without a separate request for permission.&lt;ref name=&quot;6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy&quot; /&gt;

The issue of AIM's security was called into question. AOL stated that it had taken great steps to insure that personal information will not be accessed by unauthorized members, but that it cannot guarantee that it will not happen.&lt;ref name=&quot;6 Facts About AIM's Privacy Policy&quot; /&gt;

AIM was different from other clients, such as [[Yahoo! Messenger]], in that it did not require approval from users to be added to other users' buddy lists. As a result, it was possible for users to keep other unsuspecting users on their buddy list to see when they were online, read their status and away messages, and read their profiles. There was also a Web API to display one's status and away message as a widget on one's webpage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.aol.com/data_sheets/WebAIM_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf |title=Integrate Your Site with AIM in 3 Easy Steps |work=AOL Developer Network |publisher=AOL Inc |page=2 |format=PDF |access-date=August 9, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726062640/http://dev.aol.com/data_sheets/WebAIM_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though one could block a user from communicating with them and seeing their status, this did not prevent that user from creating a new account that would not automatically be blocked and therefore able to track their status. A more conservative privacy option was to select a menu feature that only allowed communication with users on one's buddy list; however, this option also created the side-effect of blocking all users who were not on one's buddy list.

==Chat robots==
AOL and various other companies supplied robots (bots) on AIM that could receive messages and send a response based on the bot's purpose. For example, bots could help with studying, like StudyBuddy. Some were made to relate to children and teenagers, like [[Spleak]].

Others gave advice, and others were for more general purposes, such as false. The more useful chat bots had features like the ability to play games, get sport scores, weather forecasts or financial stock information. Users were able to talk to automated chat bots that could respond to natural human language. They were primarily put into place as a marketing strategy and for unique advertising options. It was used by advertisers to market products or build better consumer relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/aol-tries-out-new-im-chat-bot/|title=tries out new IM chat bot |date=2003-01-27 |access-date=2015-10-27|website=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the inclusions of such bots, the other bots DoorManBot and AIMOffline provided features that were provided by AOL for those who needed it. ZolaOnAOL and ZoeOnAOL were short-lived bots that ultimately retired their features in favor of SmarterChild.

==URI scheme==
AOL Instant Messenger's installation process automatically installed an extra [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI scheme]] (&quot;protocol&quot;) handler into some Web browsers, so URIs beginning &quot;&lt;tt&gt;aim:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; could open a new AIM window with specified parameters. This was similar in function to the &lt;tt&gt;mailto:&lt;/tt&gt; URI scheme, which created a new e-mail message using the system's default mail program. For instance, a webpage might have included a link like the following in its HTML source to open a window for sending a message to the AIM user ''notarealuser'':
 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser&quot;&amp;gt;Send Message&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

To specify a message body, the &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; parameter was used, so the link location would have looked like this:
 &lt;code&gt;aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser&amp;message=This+is+my+message&lt;/code&gt;

To specify an away message, the message parameter was used, so the link location would have looked like this:
 &lt;code&gt;aim:goaway?message=Hello,+my+name+is+Bill&lt;/code&gt;
When placing this inside a URL link, an AIM user could click on the URL link and the away message &quot;Hello, my name is Bill&quot; would instantly become their away message.

To add a buddy, the addbuddy message was used, with the &quot;screenname&quot; parameter
 &lt;code&gt;aim:addbuddy?screenname=notarealuser&lt;/code&gt;
This type of link was commonly found on forum profiles to easily add contacts.

==Vulnerabilities==
AIM had security weaknesses that have enabled [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] to be created that used third-party software to perform malicious acts on users' computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;fileforum.betanews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/AOL-Instant-Messenger-for-Windows/929853714/1|title=Reviews of AOL Instant Messenger for Windows|date=2011-01-08|access-date=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most were relatively harmless, such as being kicked off the AIM service, others performed potentially dangerous actions such as sending [[computer virus|viruses]]. Some of these exploits relied on [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to spread by automatically sending instant messages that contained a [[URL|Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL) accompanied by text suggesting the receiving user click on it, an action which leads to infection, ''i.e.'', a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]]. These messages could easily be mistaken as coming from a friend and contain a link to a Web address that installed software on the user's computer to restart the cycle.

Users also have reported sudden additions of toolbars and advertisements from third parties in the newer version of AIM. Multiple complaints about the lack of control of third party involvement have caused many users to stop using the service.&lt;ref name=&quot;fileforum.betanews.com&quot; /&gt;

==Extra features==

===iPhone application===
On March 6, 2008, during [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[IOS SDK|iPhone SDK]] event, AOL announced that they would be releasing an AIM application for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] users. The application is available for free from the App Store, but the company also provides a paid version, which displays no advertisements. Both are available from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. The AIM client for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] supports standard AIM accounts as well as [[MobileMe]] accounts. There is also an express version of AIM accessible through the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] browser on the iPhone and iPod Touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2008/03/06/apple-releases-iphone-sdk-demos-spore-instant-messaging/ |title=Apple Releases iPhone SDK, Demos Spore, Instant Messaging |publisher=Mac Rumors |date=2008-03-06 |access-date=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, AOL launched an overhaul of their Instant Messaging service. Included in the update was a brand new [[iOS]] application for iPhone and [[iPod Touch]] that incorporated all the latest features. A brand new icon was used for the application, featuring the new cursive logo for AIM. The user-interface was entirely redone for the features including: a new buddy list, group messaging, in-line photos and videos, as well as improved file-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2396491,00.asp/ |title=AOL Overhauls AIM, Adds New iPhone App |magazine=PC Magazine |date=2011-11-16 |access-date=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently{{When|date=April 2019}} the application is in version 5.0.5, which was updated as of March 2012. In the latest iteration, it supports more social stream features, much like Facebook and Twitter, as well as the ability to send voice messages up to 60 seconds long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://handheld.softpedia.com/get/Chat/AIM-for-iPhone-97755.shtml/ |title=AIM for iPhone 5.0.5 |publisher=Softpedia |date=2012-03-20 |access-date=2012-03-25 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227011258/http://handheld.softpedia.com/get/Chat/AIM-for-iPhone-97755.shtml |archivedate=2011-12-27 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iPad application===
On April 3, 2010, Apple released the first generation iPad. Along with this newly released device AOL released the AIM application for iPad. It was built entirely from scratch for the new version iOS with a specialized user-interface for the device. It supports geo location, Facebook status updates and chat, Myspace, Twitter, YouTube, Foursquare and many social networking platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macstories.net/ipad/aim-for-ipad-approved-screenshot/ |title=AIM for iPad Approved, Screenshot |publisher=MacStories |date=2010-04-01 |access-date=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIM Express===
AIM Express ran in a pop-up browser window. It was intended for use by people who are unwilling or unable to install a standalone application or those at computers that lack the AIM application. AIM Express supported many of the standard features included in the stand-alone client, but did not provide advanced features like file transfer, audio chat, video conferencing, or buddy info. It was implemented in [[Adobe Flash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.com/products/express |title=www.aim.com/products/express |publisher=Aim.com |access-date=2010-12-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205062532/http://www.aim.com/products/express| archivedate=December 5, 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an upgrade to the prior AOL Quick Buddy, which was later available for older systems that cannot handle Express before being discontinued. Express and Quick Buddy were similar to [[Windows Live Messenger#MSN Web Messenger|MSN Web Messenger]] and [[Yahoo! Messenger#Web Messenger|Yahoo! Web Messenger]]. This web version evolved into AIM.com's web-based messenger.

===AIM Pages===
{{Main|AIM Pages}}
AIM Pages was released in May 2006, allowing the 63 million AIM users to create an online, dynamic profile. The buddy list serves as the basis for the AIM Page [[social networking service]]. An AIM Page is built using modules following the ModuleT [[microformat]]. AIM Pages was discontinued in late 2007.

===AIM for Mac===
AOL released an all-new AIM for the [[Macintosh]] on September 29, 2008 and the final build on December 15, 2008. The redesigned AIM for Mac is a full [[universal binary]] [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa API]] application that supports both Tiger and Leopard&amp;nbsp;— [[macOS|Mac OS X]] 10.4.8 (and above) or Mac OS X 10.5.3 (and above). On October 1, 2009, AOL released AIM 2.0 for Mac.

===AIM real-time IM===
This feature is available for AIM 7 and allows for a user to see what the other is typing as it is being done. It was developed and built with assistance from Trace Research and Development Centre at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and [[Gallaudet University]]. The application provides visually impaired users the ability to convert messages from text (words) to speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;What is Real-Time IM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aniesoft.com/realtime-im.html|title=What is Real-Time IM? Source: AOL Help|work=aniesoft.com|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the application to work users must have AIM 6.8 or higher, as it is not compatible with older versions of AIM software, AIM for Mac or iChat.&lt;ref name=&quot;What is Real-Time IM&quot; /&gt;

===AIM to mobile (messaging to phone numbers)===
This feature allows text messaging to a phone number ([[Message#Increasing competition|text messaging is less functional]] than instant messaging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How-To use AIM to send a Text Message to a phone|url=https://www.engadget.com/2004/07/13/how-to-use-aol-instant-messenger-to-send-a-text-message-to-a|website=engadget.com|date=July 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinued features==

===AIM for Phoneline===
AIM Phoneline was a [[Voice over IP]] PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1194787,00.html|title=Press Releases|publisher=|access-date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided via the AIM application. It was also known to work with Apple's iChat Client.

Launched on May 16, 2006, AIM Phoneline provided users the ability to have several local numbers, allowing AIM users to receive free incoming calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labnol.blogspot.ca/2006/05/aim-phoneline-free-phone-number-for.html|title=AIM Phoneline: Free Phone number for AOL Messenger users|publisher=|access-date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service allowed users to make calls to landlines and mobile devices through the use of a computer. The service, however, was only free for receiving and AOL charged users $14.95 a month for an unlimited calling plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcworld.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/126005/first_look_aim_phoneline_and_skype_25.html|title=First Look: AIM Phoneline and Skype 2.5|date=June 19, 2006|work=PCWorld|access-date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to use AIM Phoneline users had to install the latest free version of AIM Triton software and needed a good set of headphones with a boom microphone. It could take several days after a user signed up before it started working.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcworld.com&quot; /&gt;

On January 13, 2009, the service was officially closed. The closing of the free service caused the number associated with the service to be disabled and not transferable for a different service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21456143-Free-AIM-Phoneline-Service-Closing-on-January-13-2009|title=Free AIM Phoneline Service Closing on January 13, 2009&amp;nbsp;— VOIP Tech Chat&amp;nbsp;— DSLReports Forums|publisher=|access-date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIM Call Out===
AIM Call Out is a discontinued Voice over IP PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service provided by AOL via its AIM application that replaced the defunct AIM Phoneline service in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimphoneline.com/?promo=784114&amp;flv=1&amp;ncid=oyjqUzrKfk0000000465&amp;icid=one_click.M|title=Looking for AIM Phoneline?|publisher=Aimphoneline.com|access-date=2008-10-02}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not depend on the AIM client and could be used with only an AIM screenname via the WebConnect feature or a dedicated SIP device. The AIM Call Out service was shut down on March 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voice.aol.com/|title=AOL Voice Services no longer offers new registrations|website=AOL.com|access-date=2014-12-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218012459/http://voice.aol.com/|archivedate=December 18, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
On November 4, 2014, AIM scored one out of seven points on the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]'s secure messaging scorecard. AIM received a point for encryption during transit, but lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key to which the provider has no access, ''i.e.'', the communications are not [[End-to-end encryption|end-to-end encrypted]], users can't verify contacts' identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen, (''i.e.'', the service does not provide [[forward secrecy]]), the code is not open to independent review, ''i.e.'', the code is not [[Open-source software|open-source]]), the security design is not properly documented, and there has not been a recent independent security audit.&lt;ref name=&quot;secure-messaging-scorecard&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |title=Secure Messaging Scorecard.

All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.

After Ackermann's publication&lt;ref name=&quot;Ack&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wilhelm Ackermann | journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] | title=Zum Hilbertschen Aufbau der reellen Zahlen | year=1928 | volume=99 | pages=118–133 | url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/dms/loader/img/?PPN=PPN235181684_0099&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0009 | doi=10.1007/BF01459088}}&lt;/ref&gt; of his function (which had three nonnegative integer arguments), many authors modified it to suit various purposes, so that today &quot;the Ackermann function&quot; may refer to any of numerous variants of the original function. One common version, the two-argument '''Ackermann–Péter function''', is defined as follows for nonnegative integers ''m'' and ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{array}{lcl}
\operatorname{A}(0, n) &amp; = &amp; n + 1 \\
\operatorname{A}(m+1, 0) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{A}(m, 1) \\
\operatorname{A}(m+1, n+1) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{A}(m, A(m+1, n))
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Its value grows rapidly, even for small inputs. For example, {{nowrap|''A''(4, 2)}} is an integer of 19,729 decimal digits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosara.net/thoughts/ackermann42.html Decimal expansion of A(4,2)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317104411/http://www.kosara.net/thoughts/ackermann42.html |date=March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to 2&lt;sup&gt;65536&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;3, or 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;3).

==History==
In the late 1920s, the mathematicians [[Gabriel Sudan]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], students of [[David Hilbert]], were studying the foundations of computation. Both Sudan and Ackermann are credited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cristian Calude, [[Solomon Marcus]] and Ionel Tevy | journal = Historia Math. | title=The first example of a recursive function which is not primitive recursive | date=November 1979 | pages=380–84 | volume=6 | issue=4 | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(79)90024-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with discovering [[total function|total]] [[computable function]]s (termed simply &quot;recursive&quot; in some references) that are not [[primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]]. Sudan published the lesser-known [[Sudan function]], then shortly afterwards and independently, in 1928, Ackermann published his function &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; (the Greek letter ''[[phi]]''). Ackermann's three-argument function, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, p)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined such that for ''p'' = 0, 1, 2, it reproduces the basic operations of [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] as
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, 0) = m+n,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, 1) = m\cdot n,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, 2) = m^n,&lt;/math&gt;
and for ''p'' &gt; 2 it extends these basic operations in a way that can be compared to the [[hyperoperation]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, 3) = m\uparrow^2 (n+1),\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, p) \gtrapprox m\uparrow^{p - 1}(n+1)\ \ (p \ge 4).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
(Aside from its historic role as a total-computable-but-not-primitive-recursive function, Ackermann's original function is seen to extend the basic arithmetic operations beyond exponentiation, although not as seamlessly as do variants of Ackermann's function that are specifically designed for that purpose—such as [[Reuben Goodstein|Goodstein's]] [[hyperoperation]] sequence.)

In ''On the Infinite'', David Hilbert hypothesized that the Ackermann function was not primitive recursive, but it was Ackermann, Hilbert's personal secretary and former student, who actually proved the hypothesis in his paper ''On Hilbert's Construction of the Real Numbers''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ack&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Heijenoort. [http://mathgate.info/cebrown/notes/vonHeijenoort.php From Frege To Gödel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504224223/http://mathgate.info/cebrown/notes/vonHeijenoort.php |date=May 4, 2008 }}, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rózsa Péter]] and [[Raphael Robinson]] later developed a two-variable version of the Ackermann function that became preferred by many authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Raphael M. Robinson | title=Recursion and Double Recursion | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | year=1948 | volume=54 | pages=987–93 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&amp;version=1.0&amp;service=UI&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183512393&amp;page=record | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1948-09121-2 | issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and properties==
Ackermann's original three-argument function &lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, p)&lt;/math&gt; is defined [[recursion|recursively]] as follows for nonnegative integers ''m'', ''n'', and ''p'':

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{array}{lr}
\varphi(m, n, 0) = m + n \\
\varphi(m, 0, 1) = 0 \\
\varphi(m, 0, 2) = 1 \\
\varphi(m, 0, p) = m \text{ for } p &gt; 2 \\
\varphi(m, n, p) = \varphi(m, \varphi(m, n-1, p), p - 1) \text{ for } n &gt; 0 \text{ and } p &gt; 0.
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Of the various two-argument versions, the one developed by Péter and Robinson (called &quot;the&quot; Ackermann function by some authors) is defined for nonnegative integers ''m'' and ''n'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{array}{lcl}
\operatorname{A}(0, n) &amp; = &amp; n + 1 \\
\operatorname{A}(m+1, 0) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{A}(m, 1) \\
\operatorname{A}(m+1, n+1) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{A}(m, A(m+1, n))
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

It may not be immediately obvious that the evaluation of &lt;math&gt; A(m, n)&lt;/math&gt; always terminates. However, the recursion is bounded because in each recursive application either ''m'' decreases, or ''m'' remains the same and ''n'' decreases. Each time that ''n'' reaches zero, ''m'' decreases, so ''m'' eventually reaches zero as well. (Expressed more technically, in each case the pair (''m'', ''n'') decreases in the [[lexicographic order]] on pairs, which is a [[well-order]]ing, just like the ordering of single non-negative integers; this means one cannot go down in the ordering infinitely many times in succession.) However, when ''m'' decreases there is no upper bound on how much ''n'' can increase—and it will often increase greatly.

The Péter-Ackermann function can also be expressed in terms of various other versions of the Ackermann function:
* the indexed version of [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] (extended to integer indices ≥ −2):
::&lt;math&gt;A(m,n)=2\uparrow^{m-2} (n+3) - 3.&lt;/math&gt;
:The part of the definition {{nowrap|1=''A''(''m'', 0) = ''A''(''m'' − 1, 1)}} corresponds to &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow^{m+1} 3=2\uparrow^m 4.&lt;/math&gt;

* [[Conway chained arrow notation]]:
::&lt;math&gt;A(m,n)=(2\rightarrow(n+3)\rightarrow(m-2))-3&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;m\geq3&lt;/math&gt;
:hence
::&lt;math&gt;2\rightarrow n\rightarrow m=A(m+2,n-3)+3&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.
:({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}} and {{Nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} would correspond with {{nowrap|1=''A''(''m'', −2) = −1}} and {{nowrap|1=''A''(''m'', −1) = 1}}, which could logically be added.)
* Using the [[hyperoperation]]s notation, {{nowrap|''A''(''m'', ''n'')}} can be expressed as {{nowrap|2[''m''](''n'' − 3) − 3}}, for {{nowrap|''m'' &gt; 1}}.

For small values of ''m'' like 1, 2, or 3, the Ackermann function grows relatively slowly with respect to ''n'' (at most [[exponential growth|exponentially]]). For {{nowrap|''m'' ≥ 4}}, however, it grows much more quickly; even {{nowrap|''A''(4, 2)}} is about 2{{e|19728}}, and the decimal expansion of {{nowrap|''A''(4, 3)}} is very large by any typical measure.

One interesting aspect of the Ackermann function is that the only arithmetic operations it ever uses are addition and subtraction of 1. Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited recursion. This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output, and so is also extremely huge. In actuality, for most cases the running time is far larger than the output; see below.

A single-argument version {{nowrap|1=''f''(''n'') = ''A''(''n'', ''n'')}} that increases both ''m'' and ''n'' at the same time dwarfs every primitive recursive function, including very fast-growing functions such as the [[exponential function]], the factorial function, multi- and [[superfactorial]] functions, and even functions defined using Knuth's up-arrow notation (except when the indexed up-arrow is used). It can be seen that ''f''(''n'') is roughly comparable to ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ω''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') in the [[fast-growing hierarchy]]. This extreme growth can be exploited to show that ''f'', which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a [[Turing machine]] and so is a [[computable function]], grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive.

In a category with [[Exponential object|exponentials]], using the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;((X \times Y) \rightarrow Z) \cong (X \rightarrow (Y \rightarrow Z))&lt;/math&gt; (in computer science, this is called [[currying]]), the Ackermann function may be defined via primitive recursion over higher-order functionals as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
\operatorname{Ack}(0) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{S} \\
\operatorname{Ack}(m+1) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{Iter}(\operatorname{Ack}(m))
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|S(''n'') {{=}} ''n'' + 1}} is the usual [[successor function]] and Iter denotes the [[functional power]] operator, defined by primitive recursion as well:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
\operatorname{Iter}(f)(0) &amp; = &amp; f(1) \\
\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n+1) &amp; = &amp; f(\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n)).
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ack}&lt;/math&gt; defined in this way agrees with the Ackermann function &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; defined above: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ack}(m)(n)=A(m,n)&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Ackerman(3,3).png|thumb|399x399px|Number of recursions before the return of Ackerman(3,3)]]
&lt;br /&gt;

==Example expansions==
To see how the Ackermann function grows so quickly, it helps to expand out some simple expressions using the rules in the original definition. For example, one can fully evaluate &lt;math&gt;A(1, 2)&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A(1,2) &amp; = A(0, A(1, 1)) \\
&amp; = A(0, A(0, A(1, 0))) \\
&amp; = A(0, A(0, A(0, 1))) \\
&amp; = A(0, A(0, 2)) \\
&amp; = A(0, 3) \\
&amp; = 4.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

To demonstrate how &lt;math&gt;A(4, 3)&lt;/math&gt;'s computation results in many steps and in a large number:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A(4, 3) &amp; = A(3, A(4, 2)) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(4, 1))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(4, 0)))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(3, 1)))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(3, 0))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(2, 1))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(2, 0)))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(1, 1)))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(1, 0))))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(0, 1))))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, 2)))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, 3))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(1, 2)))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(1, 1))))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(1, 0)))))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(0, 1)))))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, 2)) )) )) ) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, 3)))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, 4)))))  \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, 5)))) \\
&amp; = \ldots \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, 13))) \\
&amp; = \ldots \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, 65533)) \\
&amp; = \ldots \\
&amp; = A(3, 2^{65536} - 3) \\
&amp; = \ldots \\
&amp; = 2^{2^{ \overset{65536}{} }} - 3. \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Table of values ==
Computing the Ackermann function can be restated in terms of an infinite table. First, place the natural numbers along the top row. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left. Then use that number to look up the required number in the column given by that number and one row up. If there is no number to its left, simply look at the column headed &quot;1&quot; in the previous row. Here is a small upper-left portion of the table:

The numbers here which are only expressed with recursive exponentiation or [[Knuth's up-arrow notation|Knuth arrows]] are very large and would take up too much space to notate in plain decimal digits.

Despite the large values occurring in this early section of the table, some even larger numbers have been defined, such as [[Graham's number]], which cannot be written with any small number of Knuth arrows. This number is constructed with a technique similar to applying the Ackermann function to itself recursively.

This is a repeat of the above table, but with the values replaced by the relevant expression from the function definition to show the pattern clearly:

== Proof that the Ackermann function is not primitive recursive ==
In  a sense, the Ackermann function grows faster than any [[primitive recursive function]] and therefore is not itself primitive recursive. 

Specifically, one shows that to every primitive recursive function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; there exists a non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; such that for all non-negative integers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;A(t,\max_i x_i).&lt;/math&gt;
Once this is established, it follows that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; itself is not primitive recursive, since otherwise putting &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2=t&lt;/math&gt; would lead to the contradiction &lt;math&gt;A(t,t)&lt;A(t,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://planetmath.org/ackermannfunctionisnotprimitiverecursive|title=Ackermann function is not primitive recursive {{!}} planetmath.org|last=Woo|first=Chi|date=2009-12-17|website=planetmath.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509202634/http://planetmath.org/ackermannfunctionisnotprimitiverecursive|archive-date=2013-05-09|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; proceeds as follows: define the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; of all functions that grow slower than the Ackermann function
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}=\left\{ f \mid \exists t\ \forall x_1\cdots \forall x_n:\ f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;A(t, \max_i x_i) \right\}   &lt;/math&gt;
and show that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; contains all primitive recursive functions. The latter is achieved by showing that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; contains the constant functions, the successor function, the projection functions and that it is closed under the operations of function composition and primitive recursion.

== Inverse ==
Since the function {{nowrap|1=&amp;nbsp;''f''(''n'') = ''A''(''n'', ''n'')}} considered above grows very rapidly, its [[inverse function]], ''f''{{i sup|−1}}, grows very slowly. This '''inverse Ackermann function''' ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is usually denoted by '''''α'''''. In fact, ''α''(''n'') is less than 5 for any practical input size ''n'', since {{nowrap|''A''(4, 4)}} is on the order of &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{2^{2^{16}}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

This inverse appears in the time [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of some [[algorithm]]s, such as the [[disjoint-set data structure]] and [[Bernard Chazelle|Chazelle]]'s algorithm for [[minimum spanning tree]]s. Sometimes Ackermann's original function or other variations are used in these settings, but they all grow at similarly high rates. In particular, some modified functions simplify the expression by eliminating the −3 and similar terms.

A two-parameter variation of the inverse Ackermann function can be defined as follows, where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor function]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(m,n) = \min\{i \geq 1 : A(i,\lfloor m/n \rfloor) \geq \log_2 n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This function arises in more precise analyses of the algorithms mentioned above, and gives a more refined time bound. In the disjoint-set data structure, ''m'' represents the number of operations while ''n'' represents the number of elements; in the minimum spanning tree algorithm, ''m'' represents the number of edges while ''n'' represents the number of vertices.
Several slightly different definitions of {{nowrap|''α''(''m'', ''n'')}} exist; for example, {{nowrap|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''}} is sometimes replaced by ''n'', and the floor function is sometimes replaced by a [[ceiling function|ceiling]].

Other studies might define an inverse function of one where m is set to a constant, such that the inverse applies to a particular row.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15618233 An inverse-Ackermann style lower bound for the online minimum spanning tree verification problem] November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as benchmark==
The Ackermann function, due to its definition in terms of extremely deep recursion, can be used as a benchmark of a [[compiler]]'s ability to optimize recursion. The first published use of Ackermann's function in this way was in 1970 by Dragoş Vaida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal|last=Vaida|first=Dragoş|date=1970|title=Compiler Validation for an Algol-like Language|journal=Bulletin Mathématique de la Société des Sciences Mathématiques de la République Socialiste de Roumanie, Nouvelle Série|volume=14 (60)|issue=4|pages=487–502|jstor=43679758}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and, almost simultaneously, in 1971, by Yngve Sundblad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal|last=Sundblad|first=Yngve|date=1971-03-01|title=The Ackermann function. A theoretical, computational, and formula manipulative study|journal=BIT Numerical Mathematics|volume=11|issue=1|pages=107–119|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|doi=10.1007/BF01935330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sundblad's seminal paper was taken up by Brian Wichmann (co-author of the [[Whetstone (benchmark)|Whetstone benchmark]]) in a trilogy of papers written between 1975 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ackermann's Function: A Study In The Efficiency Of Calling Procedures | year = 1975 | url=http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/Imp_Benchmarks/ack.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How to Call Procedures, or Second Thoughts on Ackermann's Function | year = 1977 | url=http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/Imp_Benchmarks/ackpe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Latest results from the procedure calling test, Ackermann's function | year = 1982 | url=http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/Imp_Benchmarks/acklt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Antarctic comprises the continent of [[Antarctica]], the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] and other [[List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands|island territories]] located on the [[Antarctic Plate]] or south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]. The Antarctic region includes the [[ice shelf|ice shelves]], waters, and all the [[island]] territories in the [[Southern Ocean]] situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]], a zone approximately {{convert|32|to|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide varying in latitude seasonally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scar.org/ |title=Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research website |publisher=SCAR |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214094758/http://www.scar.org/ |archivedate=2013-12-14 |url-status=dead |access-date=2015-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The region covers some 20 percent of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], of which 5.5 percent (14 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of [[60th parallel south|60°S latitude]] are administered under the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. [[Biogeographically]], the [[Antarctic ecozone]] is one of eight [[ecozone]]s of the Earth's land surface.

== Geography ==

[[File:Expeditions in Antarctica before 1897.svg|thumb|right|[[Anthony de la Roché]]'s and other early voyages in the [[Southern Ocean]]]]
The maritime part of the region constitutes the area of application of the international [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), where for technical reasons the Convention uses an approximation of the Convergence line by means of a line joining specified points along [[Circle of latitude|parallels of latitude]] and [[Meridian (geography)|meridians of longitude]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/bd/pt1.pdf Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505214806/http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/E/e_pubs/bd/pt1.pdf |date=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The implementation of the Convention is managed through an international Commission headquartered in [[Hobart]], Australia, by an efficient system of annual [[fishing]] quotas, licenses and international inspectors on the fishing vessels, as well as [[satellite]] surveillance.

Most of the Antarctic region is situated south of 60°S latitude parallel, and is governed in accordance with the international legal regime of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp Antarctic Treaty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117002928/https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp |date=2012-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Treaty area covers the continent itself and its immediately adjacent islands, as well as the [[archipelago]]s of the [[South Orkney Islands]], [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Peter I Island|Peter&amp;nbsp;I Island]], [[Scott Island]] and [[Balleny Islands]].

The islands situated between 60°S latitude parallel to the south and the [[Antarctic Convergence]] to the north, and their respective {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} [[exclusive economic zone]]s fall under the national jurisdiction of the countries that possess them: [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] (United Kingdom; also an [[European Union|EU]] [[Overseas Countries and Territories#Overseas countries and territories|Overseas territory]]), [[Bouvet Island]] (Norway), and [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard and McDonald Islands]] (Australia).

[[Kerguelen Islands]] (France; also an EU Overseas territory) are situated in the Antarctic Convergence area, while the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Isla de los Estados]], [[Hornos Island]] with [[Cape Horn]], [[Diego Ramírez Islands]], [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]], [[Macquarie Island]], [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] and [[Île Saint-Paul|Saint Paul]] Islands, [[Crozet Islands]], [[Prince Edward Islands]], and [[Gough Island]] and [[Tristan da Cunha|Tristan da Cunha group]] remain north of the Convergence and thus outside the Antarctic region.

The first Antarctic land discovered was the island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#Geography|South Georgia]], visited by the [[Kingdom of England|English]] merchant [[Anthony de la Roché]] in 1675. Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' (&quot;Southern Land&quot;) date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent of [[Antarctica]] is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the [[List of Russian explorers|Russian expedition]] of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] on ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' and ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]''. The first human born in the Antarctic was [[Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen]] born on 8 October 1913 in [[Grytviken]], South Georgia.

The Antarctic region had no [[indigenous population]] when first discovered, and its present inhabitants comprise a few thousand transient [[science|scientific]] and other personnel working on tours of duty at the several dozen [[Research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] maintained by various countries.  However, the region is visited by more than 40,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.zenn.net/REPLACE/CLIENT/1000037/1000116/application/pdf/touristsbynationality_total2.pdf IAATO tourist statistics 2007/08]&lt;/ref&gt; tourists annually, the most popular destinations being the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] area (especially the [[South Shetland Islands]]) and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#Geography|South Georgia Island]].

In December 2009, the growth of [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], with consequences for both the ecology and the safety of the travellers in its great and remote wilderness, was noted at a conference in New Zealand by experts from signatories to the [[Antarctic Treaty]]. The definitive results of the conference was presented at the Antarctic Treaty states' meeting in Uruguay in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.680news.com/news/world/article/5976 Antarctic Nations Considering New Controls On Ships Amid Tourism Explosion.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118154613/http://www.680news.com/news/world/article/5976 |date=2012-01-18 }} Ray Lilley, The Associated Press, 8 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time zones ==
{{main|Time in Antarctica}}
Because Antarctica surrounds the South Pole, it is theoretically located in all [[time zone]]s. For practical purposes, time zones are usually based on [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|territorial claims]] or the time zone of a station's owner country or supply base.

The [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Origin of the Albanians|Albanians]] and their [[Albanian language|language]] is a matter of controversy among [[historian]]s and [[ethnologist]]s. They were mentioned for the first time in [[historical record]]s from the 11th century as a tribe of people living across the mountainous region of the [[Mat (river)|Mat]] and [[Drin River|Drin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert Elsie |title=Early Albania: A Reader of Historical Texts, 11th-17th Centuries |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003 |isbn=9783447047838 |pages=4–5 |language=English|author1-link=Robert Elsie |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albaner (Name und Ethnogenese) |url=https://research.uni-leipzig.de/gwzo/wissensdatenbank/dokumente/Albaner%20(Name%20und%20Ethnogenese).pdf |website=research.uni-leipzig.de |pages=1–2 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shkumbin]] more southerly splits the Albanians into the [[Ghegs]] and [[Tosks]] nevertheless both groups identify with a shared ethnic culture, history and traditions.

The history of the [[Albanian diaspora]] is centuries old and has its roots in migration from the [[Middle Ages]] initially established in [[Southern Europe]] and subsequently on across other parts of Europe and the [[New World]]. Between the 13th and 18th centuries, sizeable numbers of Albanians migrated to escape either various social, economic or political difficulties.{{efn|See:&lt;ref name=&quot;Riehl238&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Riehl|2010|p=238}}. &quot;Other interesting groups in the context of European migration include the Albanians who from the thirteenth century immigrated to Greece (i.e., the so-called &quot;Arvanites&quot;, see Sasse 1998) and to Southern Italy (Calabria, Sicily, cf Breu 2005).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasse2426&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gogonas3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall2829&quot;/&gt;}}

One population, the [[Arvanites]], settled [[Southern Greece]] between the 13th and 16th centuries assimilating into and now [[Hellenization|self-identifying]] as Greeks.{{efn|See:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall2829&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bintliff137138&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liakos230&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Liakos|2012|p=230}}. &quot;The term &quot;Arvanite&quot; is the medieval equivalent of &quot;Albanian.&quot; it is retained today for the descendants of the Albanian tribes that migrated to the Greek lands during a period covering two centuries, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liotta198&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pappas28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pappas}}. para. 28. &quot;While the bulk of stradioti rank and file were of Albanian origin from Greece, by the middle of the 16th century there is evidence that many had become Hellenized or even Italianized... Hellenization was perhaps well on its way prior to service abroad, since Albanian stradioti had settled in Greek lands for two generations prior to their emigration to Italy. Since many served under Greek commanders and served together with Greek stradioti, the process continued. Another factor in this assimilative process was the stradioti's and their families' active involvement and affiliation with the Greek Orthodox or Uniate Church communities in Naples, Venice and elsewhere. Hellenization thus occurred as a result of common service and church affiliation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VeremisKolipoulos2425&quot;/&gt;}} Another population who emerged as the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] settled [[Sicily]] and [[Southern Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasse2426&quot;/&gt; Smaller populations such as the [[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]] whose migration dates back to the 18th century are located in [[Dalmatia|Southern Croatia]] and scattered across [[Ukraine|Southern Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barancic551&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barančić|2008|p=551}}. &quot;Možemo reći da svi na neki način pripadamo nekoj vrsti etničke kategorije, a često i više nego jednoj. Kao primjer navodim slučaj zadarskih Arbanasa. Da bismo shvatili Arbanase i problem njihova etnojezičnog (etničkog i jezičnog) identiteta, potrebno je ići u povijest njihova doseljenja koje seže u početak 18. st., tj. točnije: razdoblje od prve seobe 1726., razdoblje druge seobe od 1733., pa sve do 1754. godine koja se smatra završnom godinom njihova doseljenja. Svi su se doselili iz tri sela s područja Skadarskog jezera – Briske, Šestana i Livara. Bježeći od Turaka, kuge i ostalih nevolja, generalni providur Nicola Erizzo II dozvolio im je da se nasele u područje današnjih Arbanasa i Zemunika. Jedan dio stanovništva u Zemuniku se asimilirao s ondašnjim stanovništvom zaboravivši svoj jezik. To su npr. današnji Prenđe, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke itd. Drugi dio stanovništva je nastojao zadržati svoj etnički i jezični identitet tijekom ovih 280 godina. Dana 10. svibnja 2006. godine obilježena je 280. obljetnica njihova dolaska u predgrađe grada Zadra. Nije bilo lako, osobito u samom početku, jer nisu imali svoju crkvu, škole itd., pa je jedini način održavanja njihova identiteta i jezika bio usmenim putem. We can say that all in some way belong to a kind of ethnic category, and often more than one. As an example, I cite the case of Zadar Arbanasi. To understand the problem of the Albanians and their ethnolinguistic (ethnic and linguistic) identity, it is necessary to go into the history of their immigration that goes back to the beginning of the 18th century., etc more precisely: the period from the first migration of 1726, the period of the second migration of 1733, and until 1754, which is considered to be the final year of their immigration. All they moved from three villages from the area of Lake Scutari – Briska, Šestan and Livara. Fleeing from the Ottomans, plague and other troubles, the general provider Nicola Erizzo II allowed them to settle in the area of today's Arbanasa and Zemunik. One part of the population in Zemunik became assimilated with the local population, forgetting their language. These are for example, today's Prenda, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke etc. The second part of the population tried to maintain their ethnic and linguistic identity during these 280 years. On May 10, 2006 marked the 280th anniversary of their arrival in the suburb of Zadar. It was not easy, especially in the beginning, because they did not have their own church, school, etc., and is the only way to maintain their identity and language was verbally.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Novik261262&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Novik|2015|pp=261–262}}. &quot;Historical Facts. Four villages with Albanian population are located in the Ukraine: Karakurt (Zhovtnevoe) set up in 1811 (Odessa region), Tyushki (Georgievka), Dzhandran (Gammovka) and Taz (Devninskoe) set up in 1862 (Zaporizh’a region). Before migrating to the territory of the Russian empire, Albanians had moved from the south-east of the present day Albania into Bulgaria (Varna region) because of the Osmanli invasion (Державин, 1914, 1926, 1933, 1948, pp. 156–169). Three hundred years later they had moved from Bulgaria to the Russian empire on account of Turkish-Russian opposition in the Balkan Peninsula. Ethnic Albanians also live in Moldova, Odessa and St. Petersburg. Present Day Situation. Nowadays, in the Ukraine and Russia there are an estimated 5000 ethnic Albanians. They live mainly in villages situated in the Odessa and Zaporizh’a regions. The language and many elements of traditional culture are still preserved and maintained in four Albanian villages (Будина, 2000, pp. 239–255; Иванова, 2000, pp. 40–53). From the ethnolinguistic and linguistic point of view these Albanian villages are of particular interest and value since they are excellent examples of a &quot;melting pot&quot; (Иванова, 1995, 1999). Bulgarians and Gagauzes live side by side with Albanians in Karakurt; Russians and Ukrainians share the same space with Albanians in the Azov Sea region. It is worth mentioning that in these multi-lingual environments, the Albanian patois retains original Balkan features.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Great Schism of 1054]] formalised the break of communion between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Western Catholic Church]] and was instantly reflected in Albania through the emergence of a Catholic north and Orthodox south. Inhabiting the west of [[Lake Ochrida]] and the upper valley of [[Shkumbin|River Shkumbin]], the Albanians established the [[Principality of Arbanon]] in 1190 with the capital in [[Krujë]]. In the 13th century, the [[Ghegs]] converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in larger numbers from [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] as a means to resist the pressure of [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Serbs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavrianos498&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1910&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramet381&quot;/&gt;

In the 15th century, the [[Fall of Constantinople|expanding]] [[Ottoman Empire]] overpowered the Balkan Peninsula and so the Albanians. Their consequent [[Albania under the Ottoman Empire|resistance]] to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]] won them acclaim all over Europe. In the 17th and 18th centuries, a substantial number of Albanians [[Islamisation of Albania|converted]] to [[Islam]] offering them equal opportunities and advancement within the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickers2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giakoumis8788&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myhill 2006 232&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Koti1617&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramet203204&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skendi1956321323&quot;/&gt; Hence, they attained significant positions and culturally contributed to the broader [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clayer&quot;/&gt;

The Ottomans had cut the Albanians off from significant European intellectual [[Cultural movement|movement]]s, amongst them the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and these ideas together with the ideals of [[Nationalism]] traditionally began to reach the Albanians through the [[Albanian diaspora]] conclusively leading to the [[Albanian Renaissance]] which was also incorporated with the influences of [[Romanticism]].

During the [[Balkan Wars]], the Albanians were [[Partition (politics)|partitioned]] between [[Independent Albania]], Greece, Montenegro, and Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=Imogen |title=Central and South-Eastern Europe 2003|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431360|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CrpzRJCbckC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]] until the [[Fall of communism in Albania|Revolutions of 1991]], Albania was governed by a [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist government]] launching the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation. Though in neighbouring [[Yugoslavia]], Albanians underwent periods of [[discrimination]] that concluded with the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]] and eventually the [[Independence of Kosovo]].

{{further|Albania (toponym)|Shqiptar}}

The Albanians ({{lang-sq|Shqiptarët}}) and their country Albania ({{lang-sq|Shqipëria}}) have been identified by many [[ethnonym]]s. The most common native [[ethnonym]] is &quot;Shqiptar&quot;, plural &quot;Shqiptarë&quot;; the name &quot;Albanians&quot; ([[Byzantine Greek]]: ''Albanoi/Arbanitai/Arbanites''; [[Latin]]: ''Albanenses/Arbanenses'') was used in medieval documents, that gradually entered [[European Languages|European languages]] from which other similar derivative names emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie200534&quot;/&gt;

From these ethnonyms, names for Albanians were also derived in other languages, that were or still are in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BardhylDemiraj534&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;/&gt; In [[English language|English]] &quot;Albanians&quot;; [[Italian language|Italian]] &quot;Albanesi&quot;; [[German language|German]] &quot;Albaner&quot;; [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;Arvanites&quot;, &quot;Alvanitis&quot; (Αλβανίτης) plural: &quot;Alvanites&quot; (Αλβανίτες), &quot;Alvanos&quot; (Αλβανός) plural: &quot;Alvanoi&quot; (Αλβανοί); [[Turkish language|Turkish]] &quot;Arnaut&quot;, &quot;Arnavut&quot;; [[South Slavic languages]] &quot;Arbanasi&quot; (Арбанаси), &quot;Albanci&quot; (Албанци); [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] &quot;Arbineş&quot; and so on.{{efn|See:&lt;ref name=&quot;Liotta198&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Liotta|2001|p=198}}. &quot;Among Greeks, the term &quot;Alvanitis&quot;—or &quot;Arvanitis&quot;—means a Christian of Albanian ancestry, one who speaks both Greek and Albanian, but possesses Greek &quot;consciousness.&quot; Numerous &quot;Arvanites&quot; live in Greece today, although the ability to speak both languages is shrinking as the differences (due to technology and information access and vastly different economic bases) between Greece and Albania increase. The Greek communities of Elefsis, Marousi, Koropi, Keratea, and Markopoulo (all in the Attikan peninsula) once held significant Arvanite communities. &quot;Arvanitis&quot; is not necessarily a pejorative term; a recent Pan Hellenic socialist foreign minister spoke both Albanian and Greek (but not English). A former Greek foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, was an &quot;Arvanite&quot; from Elefsis.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BardhylDemiraj534&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Demiraj|2010|p=534}}. &quot;The ethnic name shqiptar has always been discussed together with the ethnic complex: (tosk) ''arbëresh'', ''arbëror'', ''arbër'' — (gheg) ''arbënesh'', ''arbënu(e)r'', ''arbën''; i.e. [''arbën/r''(—)]. p.536. Among the neighbouring peoples and elsewhere the denomination of the Albanians is based upon the root arb/alb, cp. Greek ''’Αλβανός'', ''’Αρβανός'' &quot;Albanian&quot;, ''‘Αρβανίτης'' &quot;Arbëresh of Greece&quot;, Serbian ''Albanac'', ''Arbanas'', Bulg., Mac. ''албанец'', Arom. ''arbinés'' (Papahagi 1963 135), Turk. ''arnaut'', Ital. ''albanese'', German ''Albaner'' etc. This basis is in use among the Arbëreshs of Italy and Greece as well; cp. ''arvanit'', more rarely ''arbëror'' by the arbëreshs of Greece, as against ''arbëresh'', ''arbëresh'', ''bri(e)sh'' (beside ''gjegj'' — Altimari 1994 (1992) 53 s.). (Italy) (Kr. ?)

The term &quot;Albanoi&quot; (Αλβανοί) is first encountered twice in the works of Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]], and the term &quot;Arvanitai&quot; (Αρβανίται) is used once by the same author. He referred to the &quot;Albanoi&quot; as having taken part in a revolt against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1043, and to the &quot;Arbanitai&quot; as subjects of the Duke of Dyrrachium (modern [[Durrës]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;MadgearuGordon25b&quot;/&gt; These references have been disputed as to whether they refer to the people of Albania.&lt;ref name=&quot;MadgearuGordon25b&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Madgearu|Gordon|2008|p=25}}. &quot;It is still disputed by scholars that those Albanoi from 1042 were Normans from Sicily, [Southern Italy], or if they are in fact the Albanoi [a large clan of that belongs to the many clans of Albanians] found in Albanian lands during this time frame.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritsak5253&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pritsak|1991|pp=52–53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian E.

Within the Indo-European family, it forms a group of its own. In Albanian, the language is called shqip. Albania is called ''Shqipëri'', and the Albanians call themselves ''shqiptarë''. Until the fifteenth century the language was known as ''Arbërisht'' or ''Arbnisht'', which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name ''Albanoi'' to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as ''Arbanori'' or ''Albanon''. It is clear that the words ''Arbëresh'', ''Arvanitika'', and even ''Albanian'' and ''Albania'' are all related to the older name of the language.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[exonym]] Albania for the general region inhabited by the Albanians does have connotations to Classical Antiquity, the Albanian language employs a different ethnonym, with modern Albanians referring to themselves as ''Shqip(ë)tarë'' and to their country as ''Shqipëria''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;/&gt; Two etymologies have been proposed for this ethnonym: one, derived from the etymology from the Albanian word for eagle (shqipe, var., shqiponjë).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;/&gt; In Albanian [[folk etymology]], this word denotes a bird [[totem]], dating from the times of Skanderbeg as displayed on the [[Albanian flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ej2-s&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=ALBANCI | encyclopedia =[[Enciklopedija Jugoslavije]] 2nd ed. | volume=Supplement | pages=1 | publisher=[[JLZ]] | location=[[Zagreb]] | year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is within scholarship that connects it to the verb 'to speak' (''me shqiptue'') from the Latin &quot;''excipere''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;/&gt; In this instance the Albanian endonym like ''[[Slav (ethnonym)|Slav]]'' [[Endonym#Tendencies in the development of exonyms|and others]] would originally have been a term connoting &quot;those who speak [intelligibly, the same language]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamusella241&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kamusella|2009|p=241}}. &quot;Prior to the emergence of the modern self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë'' in the mid-16th century (for the first time it was recorded in 1555 by the Catholic Gheg, Gjon Buzuku, in his missal), North Albanians (Ghegs) referred to themselves as ''Arbën'', and South Albanians (Tosks) ''Arbër''. Hence, the self-ethnonym ''Arbëreshë'' of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for ‘Albanians,’ which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (''Arbanasi''), Ottoman (''Arnaut''), Romanian (''Arbănas''), and Aromanian (''Arbineş''). It is clear that scholars and Albanians themselves agree that they do not agree on any single etymology of the ethnonym ‘Albanian.’ A similar predicament is faced by the self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë''. The most popular scholarly explanation is that it was formed by analogy to ‘Slavs’ (*''Slovene''), believed to be derived from ''slovo'' (‘word’), and by extension, from *''sluti'' (‘to speak clearly.’) The last explanation semantically contrasts with Slavic ''Niemiec'' (‘mute,’‘stammering,’‘babbling’), and Greek ‘barbarian’ (from ''barbaros'' ‘those who stammer, babble’). Hence, ''Shqiptarë'' could be derived from Albanian ''shqipoi'' (from Latin ''excipere'') for ‘to speak clearly, to understand.’ The Albanian public favors the belief that their self-ethnonym stems from ''shqipe'' (‘eagle’) found on the Albanian national flag.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''Shqipëri'' and ''Shqiptar'' are attested from 14th century onward,&lt;ref name=Matasović&gt;{{cite book|last=Matasović|first=Ranko|year=2019|title=A Grammatical Sketch of Albanian for Students of Indo European|url=http://mudrac.ffzg.unizg.hr/~rmatasov/Albanian.pdf|place=Zagreb|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was only at the end of 17th and beginning of the early 18th centuries that the placename ''Shqipëria'' and the ethnic demonym ''Shqiptarë'' gradually replaced ''Arbëria'' and ''Arbëreshë'' amongst [[Albanian language|Albanian]] speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Matasović /&gt; That era brought about religious and other sociopolitical changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;/&gt; As such a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman world]] emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloshi277&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lloshi|1999|p=277}}. &quot;The Albanians of today call themselves ''shqiptarë'', their country ''Shqipëri'', and their language ''shqipe''. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them ''albanesi'' (Italian), ''Albaner'' (German), ''Albanians'' (English), ''Alvanos'' (Greek), and ''Arbanasi'' (old Serbian), the country ''Albania'', ''Albanie'', ''Albanien'', ''Alvania'', and ''Albanija'', and the language ''Albanese'', ''Albanisch'', ''Albanian'', ''Alvaniki'', and ''Arbanashki'' respectively. All these words are derived from the name ''Albanoi'' of an Illyrian tribe and their center ''Albanopolis'', noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. ''Alban'' could be a plural of ''alb''- ''arb''-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains (ÇABEJ 1976). The name passed over the boundaries of the Illyrian tribe in central Albania, and was generalised for all the Albanians. They called themselves ''arbënesh'', ''arbëresh'', the country ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri'', and the language ''arbëneshe'', ''arbëreshe''. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by ''shqiptarë'', ''Shqipëri'' and ''shqipe''. The primary root is the adverb ''shqip'', meaning &quot;clearly, intelligibly&quot;. There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun ''Deutsche'', &quot;the Germans&quot; and &quot;the German language&quot; (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and ''Shqipni/Shqipëri'' is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri''. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical records ===
{{see also|Origin of the Albanians}}

Little is known about the Albanian people prior to the 11th century, though a text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century in the [[Bulgarian language]] contains possibly a reference to the Albanian people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie3&quot;/&gt; It is preserved in a [[manuscript]] written in the [[Serbo-Croatian Language|Serbo-Croatian language]] traced back to the 17th century but published in the 20th century by Radoslav Grujic. It is a fragment of a once longer text that endeavours to explain the origins of peoples and languages in a question-and-answer form similar to a [[catechism]].

The fragmented manuscript differentiated the world into seventy-two languages and three religious categories including [[Christians]], half-believers and non-believers. Grujic dated it to the early 11th century and if this and the identification of the Arbanasi, as Albanians, are correct it would be the earliest written document referring to the Albanian people as a people or language group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It can be seen that there are various languages on earth. Of them, there are five Orthodox languages: [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Syrian, Iberian ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]) and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Three of these have Orthodox alphabets: Greek, Bulgarian and Iberian. There are twelve languages of half-believers: Alamanians, [[Franks]], Magyars ([[Hungarians]]), Indians, Jacobites, [[Armenians]], [[Saxons]], Lechs ([[Poles]]), '''Arbanasi''' (Albanians), [[Croatians]], Hizi and [[Germans]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first undisputed mention of Albanians in the historical record is attested in Byzantine source for the first time in 1079–1080, in a work titled ''History'' by Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]], who referred to the ''Albanoi'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the duke of [[Durrës|Dyrrachium]]. It is disputed, however, whether the &quot;Albanoi&quot; of the events of 1043 refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense or whether &quot;Albanoi&quot; is a reference to [[Normans]] from [[Sicily]] under an archaic name (there was also a tribe in Italy by the name of &quot;Albanoi&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;MadgearuGordon25b&quot;/&gt; However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaleiates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078, is undisputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MadgearuGordon25&quot;/&gt; At this point, they are already fully Christianized, although [[Albanian mythology]] and folklore are part of the [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|Paleo-Balkan]] pagan mythology,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonnefoy253&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnefoy|1993|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular showing Greek influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;EliadeAdams179&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Eliade|Adams|1987|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albanian dialects.svg|thumb|right|The [[Albanian dialects|dialects]] of the [[Albanian language]] in Southern Europe.]]
 
The majority of the Albanian people speak the [[Albanian language]] which comprises an independent branch within the [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] family of [[language]]s. It is a [[language isolate]] to any other known living language in [[Europe]] and indeed no other language in the world has been conclusively associated to its branch. Its origin remains conclusively unknown but it is believed it has descended from an ancient [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan language]].
  
The Albanian language is spoken by approximately 5 million people throughout the [[Balkan Peninsula]] as well as by a more substantial number by [[Albanian diaspora|communities]] around the [[Americas]], [[Europe]] and [[Oceania]]. Numerous variants and dialects of Albanian are used as an [[official language]] in [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]] and [[North Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] |title=Constitution of the Republic of Albania |url=https://www.osce.org/albania/41888 |website=osce.org |language=Albanian, English |quote=The official language in the Republic of Albania is Albanian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Kryeministria e Kosovës |title=Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo |url=http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/Constitution1Kosovo.pdf |website=kryeministri-ks.net |page=8 |language=English |quote=The official languages in the Republic of Kosovo are Albanian and Serbian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA |url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/mk/mk014en.pdf |website=wipo.int |page=2 |language=English }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albanian becomes the second official language in Macedonia |url=https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2019/01/15/albanian-becomes-second-official-language-macedonia/ |website=europeanwesternbalkans.com |language=English |date=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is also spoken in other countries whence it is officially recognised as a [[minority language]] in such countries as [[Croatia]], [[Italy]], [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Minority language in Croatia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE CONSTITUTION OF MONTENEGRO |url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/me/me004en.pdf |website=wipo.int |page=6 |language=English }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic diversity among foreign citizens in Italy|url=http://www.istat.it/en/archive/129304|publisher=Statistics of Italy|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialects spoken in [[Albanians of Croatia|Croatia]] ([[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]] and [[Istrian Albanian|Istrian]]), [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovo]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Northwestern [[Albanians in Macedonia|North Macedonia]] are Gheg dialects, while those dialects spoken in [[Albanians in Greece|Greece]] ([[Arvanites]] and [[Cham Albanians|Çam]]), Southwestern [[Albanians in Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and Italy ([[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]) are Tosk dialects.
 
The [[Arbëresh language|Arbëreshë]] and [[Arvanitika]] languages represent varieties of the Albanian language spoken by the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]s and [[Arvanites]] in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Southern Greece]] respectively.

Most of the Albanians in Albania and the [[Former Yugoslavia]] are [[Polyglotism|polyglot]] and have the ability to understand, speak, read, or write a [[foreign language]]. As defined by the [[Institute of Statistics (Albania)|Institute of Statistics of Albania]], 39.9% of the 25 to 64 years old Albanians in Albania are able to use at least one foreign language including [[English language|English]] (40%), [[Italian language|Italian]] (27.8%) and [[Greek language|Greek]] (22.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.instat.gov.al/media/4028/adult-education-survey-2017.pdf|title=Press release of the Adult Education Survey|last=|first=|date=10 May 2018|work=Albanian Institute of Statistics|access-date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the Albanian language remains a contentious subject that has given rise to numerous [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]. The hypothesis of Albanian being one of the descendant of the [[Illyrian languages]] is based on [[Geography of Albania|geography]] where the languages were spoken however not enough archaeological evidence is left behind to come therefore to a definite conclusion. Another hypothesis associates the Albanian language with the [[Thracian language]]. This theory takes exception to the territory, since the language was spoken in an area distinct from Albania, and no significant population movements have been recorded in the period when the shift from one language to the other is supposed to have occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hock54&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|Joseph|1996|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Krujë-KrujaAlbania 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The city of [[Krujë]] served as the royal seat of the [[Principality of Arbanon]].]]

The Albanian people maintain a very chequered and tumultuous history behind them, a fact explained by their geographical position in the [[Southeast Europe|Southeast of]] [[Europe]] at the cultural and political crossroad between the east and west, even though they have often been isolated from the mainstream [[history of Europe]].

The issue surrounding the [[Origin of the Albanians|origin of the Albanian people]] has been long debated by [[historian]]s and [[linguist]]s for centuries. Many scholars consider the Albanians, in terms of [[linguistic]] evidences, the descendant population of ancient populations of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], either the [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] or another [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/ie-lg/Albanian.html|title=Indo-European Languages: Balkan Group: Albanian|last=Simmons|first=Austin|author2=Jonathan Slocum|publisher=Linguistics Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=21 October 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916055123/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/ie-lg/Albanian.html|archivedate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are insufficient evidences to derive an accurate conclusion and therefore [[Albanian origins]] still remain a mystery.
 
Historically known as the ''Arbër'' or ''Arbën'' by the 11th century and onwards, they  traditionally inhabited the mountainous area to the west of [[Lake Ochrida]] and the upper valley of the [[Shkumbin|River Shkumbin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norris35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993 |p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicol160&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nicol|1986|p=160}}. &quot;The geographical location of the mysterious 'Arbanon' has at last no doubt been settled by the researches of Alain Ducellier. In the 11th century at least it was the name given to the mountainous area to the west of Lake Ohrid and the upper valley of the river Shkumbin...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was in 1190 when they established their first independent [[Principality of Arbër|entity]] with their seat based in [[Krujë]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ducellier780a&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ducellier|1995|p=780}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the decline of the [[House of Progon|Progon dynasty]] in 1216, the principality came under [[Grigor Kamona]] and [[Gulam of Albania]]. Finally the Principality was dissolved in 1255.

A Byzantine counteroffensive soon ensued, which drove the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] out of the interior by 1281. The [[Sicilian Vespers]] further weakened the position of Charles, and the Kingdom was soon reduced by the [[Epirus (region)|Epirotes]] to a small area around [[Durrës]]. The kingdom however held out until 1368, when the city was captured by [[Karl Topia|Karl Thopia]].

In the 14th century a number of [[Albanian principalities]] were created. These included [[Principality of Kastrioti]], [[Principality of Dukagjini]], [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Princedom of Albania]], and [[Principality of Gjirokastër]]. At the beginning of the 15th century these principalities became stronger, especially because of the fall of the [[Serbian Empire]]. Some of these principalities were united in 1444 under the military alliance called [[League of Lezhë|League of Lezha]].

Albanians were recruited all over Europe as a light cavalry known as [[stratioti]]. The stratioti were pioneers of light cavalry tactics during the 15th century. In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stradioti of the Venetian army, Hungarian [[hussar]]s and German mercenary cavalry units (Schwarzreitern).&lt;ref&gt;Downing 1992, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Albania under the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest of Albania]], the political situation of the Albanian people was characterised by a fragmented conglomeration of scattered [[realm|kingdom]]s and [[Principalities of albania|principalities]] such as the [[Principality of Arbanon|Principalities of Arbanon]], [[Principality of Kastrioti|Kastrioti]] and [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Thopia]]. However, after the [[fall of Constantinople]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into the [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|Southeast Europe]]. As a consequence thousands of Albanians from [[Albania]], [[Epirus]] and [[Peloponnese]] escaped to [[Western Europe]], particularly to [[Calabria]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily (Medieval and Early Modern)|Sicily]], whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible [[Geography of Albania|Mountains of Albania]].

Under the leadership of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], a prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted with the formation of the [[League of Lezhë|Assembly of Lezhë]] up until the [[Siege of Shkodra|Siege of Shkodër]], multiple times defeating the mightiest power of the time led by [[Sultan]]s [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg managed to gather several of the Albanian principals, amongst them the [[Arianiti family|Arianiti]]s, [[Dukagjini family|Dukagjini]]s, [[Zaharia family|Zaharia]]s and [[Thopia family|Thopia]]s, and establish a centralised authority over most of the non-conquered territories instantly becoming the [[Skanderbeg|Lord of Albania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;League of Lezhë&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rob Pickard |title=Analysis and Reform of Cultural Heritage Policies in South-East Europe |date=2008 |isbn=978-92-871-6265-6 |page=16 |edition=Europarat |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Skanderbeg consistently pursued the aim relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the Ottomans. He defeated every attempt by the Ottomans to regain Albania which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of Italy and [[Western Europe]]. His unequal fight against them won the esteem of Europe also among others financial and military aid from the [[Papacy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium|title=Albania :: The decline of Byzantium – Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barletius, Marinus.

The Albanians, predominantly a Christian people, were considered as an [[Rayah|inferior class]] of people and as such they were subjected to heavy [[Jizya|tax]]es such as the [[Devshirme]] system that allowed the [[Sultan]] to collect a requisite percentage of Christian adolescents from the [[Balkans]] and elsewhere to compose the [[Janissary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Raymond Zickel and Walter R.

They were therefore to be found within the imperial services as vital military and administrative retainers from [[Egypt]] to [[Algeria]] and the rest of [[Maghreb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norris196&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the late 18th century, [[Ali Pasha Tepelena]] created the autonomous region of the [[Pashalik of Yanina]] within the [[Ottoman Empire]] which was never recognised as such by the [[High Porte]]. The territory he properly governed incorporated most of southern [[Albania]], [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]] and southwestern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. During his rule, the town of [[Janina]] blossomed into a cultural, political and economic hub for both Albanians and Greeks.

The ultimate goal of Ali Pasha Tepelena seems to have been the establishment of an independent rule in Albania and Epirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he obtained control of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and took control over the ports of [[Butrint]], [[Preveza]] and [[Vonitsa]]. He also gained control of the [[pashalik]]s of [[Elbasan]], [[Sanjak of Delvina|Delvina]], [[Pashalik of Berat|Berat]] and [[Sanjak of Avlona|Vlorë]]. His relations with the High Porte were always tense though he developed and maintained relations with the [[British Empire|British]], [[First French Empire|French]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] people and formed an alliance with them through various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Türkiye Tarihi İslam, Milliyetçilik ve Modernlik 1789-2007|last=Findley|first=Carter V.|publisher=Timaş Yayınları|year=2012|isbn=978-605-114-693-5|location=İstanbul|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas such as Albania, Western Macedonia, Southern Serbia, Kosovo, parts of northern Greece and southern Montenegro in Ottoman sources were referred to as ''Arnavudluk'' or Albania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe200688&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|pp=88}}. &quot;This Albanian participation in brigandage is easier to track than for many other social groups in Ottoman lands, because Albanian (''Arnavud'') was one of the relatively few ethnic markers regularly added to the usual religious (Muslim-Zimmi) tags used to identify people in state records. These records show that the magnitude of banditry involving Albanians grew through the 1770s and 1780s to reach crisis proportions in the 1790s and 1800s.&quot;; p.107. &quot;In light of the recent violent troubles in Kosovo and Macedonia and the strong emotions tied to them, readers are urged most emphatically not to draw either of two unwarranted conclusions from this article:  that Albanians are somehow inherently inclined to banditry, or that the extent of Ottoman &quot;Albania&quot; or ''Arnavudluk'' (which included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia) gives any historical &quot;justification&quot; for the creation of a &quot;Greater Albania&quot; today.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe772&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|p=772}}. &quot;In this case, however, Ottoman records contain useful information about the ethnicities of the leading actors in the story. Records of Ottoman Empire refer to ‘Albanians’ more frequently than most other cultural or linguistic groups. The term ‘Arnavud’ was used to denote persons who spoke one of the dialects of Albanian, came from mountainous country in the western Balkans (referred to as ‘Arnavudluk’, and including not only the area now forming the state of Albania but also neighbouring parts of Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro), organized society on the strength of blood ties (family, clan, tribe), engaged predominantly in a mix of settled agriculture and livestock herding, and were notable fighters — a group, in short, difficult to control. Other peoples, such as Georgians, Ahkhaz, Circassians, Tatars, Kurds, and Bedouin Arabs who were frequently identified by their ethnicity, shared similar cultural traits.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolovos41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kolovos|2007|p=41}}. &quot;Anscombe (ibid., 107 n. 3) notes that Ottoman &quot;Albania&quot; or ''Arnavudluk''... included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia&quot;; see also ''El2''. s.v. &quot;Arnawutluk. 6.

[[File:NaumVeqilharxhi.jpg|170px|thumb|right|[[Naum Veqilharxhi]] was one of the earliest figures of the early [[Albanian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert Elsie |authorlink1=Robert Elsie |title=Historical Dictionary of Albania |publisher=Scarecrow Press, 2010 |isbn=9780810873803 |page=469 |language=English|date=19 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Albanian Renaissance]] characterised a period wherein the Albanian people gathered both [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[intellectual]] strength to establish their rights for an independent [[political]] and [[social]] life, [[culture]] and [[education]]. By the late 18th century and the early 19th century, its foundation arose within the [[Albanian diaspora|Albanian communities]] in [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]] and [[Albanians in Romania|Romania]] and was frequently linked to the influences of the [[Romanticism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sarah Amsler |title=Theorising Social Change in Post-Soviet Countries: Critical Approaches |publisher=Peter Lang, 2007 |isbn=9783039103294 |pages=96105 |edition=Balihar Sanghera, Sarah Amsler, Tatiana Yarkova |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MzXP_r6oAxwC&amp;pg=PA96 |language=English|year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Albania was under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] for almost five centuries and the Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of unity or national conscience by the Albanian people. A number of thoroughly intellectual Albanians, among them [[Naum Veqilharxhi]], [[Girolamo de Rada]], [[Dora d'Istria]], [[Thimi Mitko]], [[Naim Frashëri|Naim]] and [[Sami Frashëri]], made a conscious effort to awaken feelings of pride and unity among their people by working to develop [[Albanian literature]] that would call to mind the rich history and hopes for a more decent future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie6593&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=65–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The Albanians had poor or often no [[school]]s or other institutions in place to protect and preserve their [[cultural heritage]]. The need for schools was preached initially by the increasing number of Albanians educated abroad. The Albanian communities in Italy and elsewhere were particularly active in promoting the Albanian cause, especially in education which finally resulted with the foundation of the [[Mësonjëtorja]] in [[Korçë]], the first [[secular school]] in the [[Albanian language]].

The [[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire|Turkish yoke]] had become fixed in the nationalist mythologies and psyches of the people in the [[Balkans]], and their march toward [[independence]] quickened. Due to the more substantial of Islamic influence, the Albanians internal social divisions, and the fear that they would lose their Albanian territories to the emerging neighbouring states, [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]], were among the last peoples in the Balkans to desire division from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth of Albania&quot;&gt;{{cite web|editor1=Raymond Zickel|editor2=Walter R.

The national awakening as a coherent political movement emerged after the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], according to which Albanian-inhabited territories were to be ceded to the neighbouring states, and focused on preventing that partition.&lt;ref name=Kaser&gt;Karl Kaser, Frank Kressing.

[[Enver Hoxha]] of the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Party of Labour]] took immediate and forceful measures for the total power over the [[nation state]] of the Albanian people, [[Albania]] in 1946. As the regimes strength began to increase, Enver Hoxha established an [[alliance]] with the [[Eastern Bloc]] which provided Albania with many advantages in the form of economic assistance and military protection from the [[Western Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]].

The Albanians experienced a period of several beneficial political and economic changes. The [[People's Republic of Albania|government]] defended the territorial [[integrity]] and [[sovereignty]] of Albania, diversified the economy through a programme of [[industrialisation]] which led to a higher [[standard of living]] and followed improvements in areas such as [[health]], [[education]] and [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Albanian Nationalism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Albanian Nationalism|url=https://www.britannica.com/pla…/Albania/Albanian-nationalism|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It subsequently followed a period wherein the Albanians lived within an extreme isolation from the rest of the world for the next four decades. By 1967, the established government had officially proclaimed Albania to be the first [[atheistic state]] in the world as they beforehand confiscated [[Christian Church|church]]es, [[monasteries]] and [[mosque]]s, and any religious expression instantly became grounds for imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-186.html|title=Albania - Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign|website=www.country-data.com|access-date=13 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective protests with the emerging [[revolutions of 1989]] began to break out in various cities throughout Albania including [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]] which eventually caused the [[Fall of communism in Albania|fall of communism]]. Finally as the communism came to a violent end in 1992, both internal and large external migration waves of Albanians, in such countries as [[Greece]] and [[Italy]], has taken place on a massive scale over the forthcoming years in Albania.

The [[bunkerisation]] is arguably the most visible and memorable legacy of the communism in Albania. Nearly 175.000 reinforced concrete [[bunker]]s were built on strategic locations across [[Geography of Albania|Albania's territory]] including near borders, within towns, on the seashores or mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bunkers of Albania|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunkers-of-albania|website=Atlas Obscura|ref=AO|access-date=21 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312044555/http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bunkers-of-albania|archive-date=12 March 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bunkers were never used for their intended purpose or for sheltered the population from attacks or an invasion by a neighbor. However, they were abandoned after the breakup of communism and have been sometimes reused for a variety of purposes.

[[Kosovo]] declared [[Independence of Kosovo|independence]] from Serbia on 17 February 2008, after years of strained relations between the Serb and predominantly [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanian]] population of Kosovo. It has been officially recognised by [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and major [[European Union]] countries, while Serbia and its ally [[Russia]] refuse to recognise Kosovo's sovereignty.
 
The overwhelming majority of Kosovo's population is ethnically Albanian with nearly 1.7 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmikosovo.org/wp-content/Publications/Policy_briefs/2012-12_ECMI_Kosovo_Policy_Brief_-_Minority_Communities_in_the_2011_Kosovo_Census_Results_Analysis_and_Recommendations/eng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103200754/http://www.ecmikosovo.org/wp-content/Publications/Policy_briefs/2012-12_ECMI_Kosovo_Policy_Brief_-_Minority_Communities_in_the_2011_Kosovo_Census_Results_Analysis_and_Recommendations/eng.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence as well as in the adjacent regions of [[Toplica District|Toplica]] and [[Moravac|Morava]] is recorded since the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe767774785788&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|pp=767–774}}, 785–788. &quot;While the ethnic roots of some settlements can be determined from the Ottoman records, Serbian and Albanian historians have at times read too much into them in their running dispute over the ethnic history of early Ottoman Kosovo. Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (tahrir defterleri) to gauge the ethnic make—up of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little. Leaving aside questions arising from the dialects and pronunciation of the census scribes, interpreters, and even priests who baptized those recorded, no natural law binds ethnicity to name. Imitation, in which the customs, tastes, and even names of those in the public eye are copied by the less exalted, is a time—tested tradition and one followed in the Ottoman Empire. Some Christian sipahis in early Ottoman Albania took such Turkic names as Timurtaş, for example, in a kind of cultural conformity completed later by conversion to Islam. Such cultural mimicry makes onomastics an inappropriate tool for anyone wishing to use Ottoman records to prove claims so modern as to have been irrelevant to the pre—modern state. The seventeenth—century Ottoman notable arid author Evliya Çelebi, who wrote a massive account of his travels around the empire and abroad, included in it details of local society that normally would not appear in official correspondence; for this reason his account of a visit to several towns in Kosovo in 1660 is extremely valuable. Evliya confirms that western and at least parts of central Kosovo were ‘Arnavud’. He notes that the town of Vučitrn had few speakers of ‘Boşnakca’; its inhabitants spoke Albanian or Turkish. He terms the highlands around Tetovo (in Macedonia), Peć, and Prizren the ‘mountains of Arnavudluk’. Elsewhere, he states that ‘the mountains of Peć’ lay in Arnavudluk, from which issued one of the rivers converging at Mitrovica, just north-west of which he sites Kosovo's border with Bosna. This river, the Ibar, flows from a source in the mountains of Montenegro north—north—west of Peć, in the region of Rozaje to which the Këlmendi would later be moved. He names the other river running by Mitrovica as the Kılab and says that it, too, had its source in Aravudluk; by this he apparently meant the Lab, which today is the name of the river descending from mountains north—east of Mitrovica to join the Sitnica north of Priština. As Evliya travelled south, he appears to have named the entire stretch of river he was following the Kılab, not noting the change of name when he took the right fork at the confluence of the Lab and Sitnica. Thus, Evliya states that the tomb of Murad I, killed in the battle of Kosovo Polje, stood beside the Kılab, although it stands near the Sitnica outside Priština. Despite the confusion of names, Evliya included in Arnavudluk not only the western fringe of Kosovo, but also the central mountains from which the Sitnica (‘Kılab’) and its first tributaries descend. Given that a large Albanian population lived in Kosovo, especially in the west and centre, both before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689–90, it remains possible, in theory, that at that time in the Ottoman Empire, one people emigrated en masse and another immigrated to take its place.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Serbs expelled many Albanians from the wider Toplica and Morava regions in Southern Serbia, which the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]] had given to the [[Principality of Serbia]], many of them settled in Kosovo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jagodic&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jagodić|1998}}. para. 1–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uka525354&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Uka|2004d|p=52}}. &quot;Pra, këtu në vazhdim, pas dëbimit të tyre me 1877–1878 do të shënohen vetëm disa patronime (mbiemra) të shqiptarëve të Toplicës dhe viseve tjera shqiptare të Sanxhakut të Nishit.

The [[Italian Peninsula]] across the [[Adriatic Sea]] has attracted the Albanian people for more than half a millennium often due to the immediate proximity and the consideration as the primary gateway to [[Western Europe]]. Albanians in Italy were those who later became important in establishing the fundamentals of the [[Albanian Renaissance]] and maintaining the [[Albanian culture]].

Centuries later in the end of the 20th century occurred another and simultaneously the largest migration cycle of Albanians to Italy surpassing the earlier migration of the Arbëreshë.

An estimated 275,000–600,000 (Includes dual citizens, temporary migrants, and undocumented) Albanians live in [[Greece]], forming the largest immigrant community in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vathi|first=Zana|title=Migrating and Settling in a Mobile World: Albanian Migrants and Their Children in Europe|url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-319-13024-8|date=18 May 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-13024-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-319-13024-8/page/n32 22]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are economic migrants whose migration began in 1991, following the collapse of the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]].

The [[Arvanites]] and [[Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace]] are a group descended from [[Tosks]] who migrated to southern and central Greece between the 13th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gogonas3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gogonas|2010|p=3}}. &quot;Arvanites originate from Albanian settlers who moved south at different times between the 14th and the 16th centuries from areas in what is today southern Albania The reasons for this migration are not entirely clear and may be manifold. In many instances the Arvanites were invited by the Byzantine and Latin rulers of the time. They were employed to resettle areas that had been largely depopulated through wars, epidemics and other reasons, and they were employed as soldiers. Some later movements are also believed to have been motivated to evade Islamisation after the Ottoman conquest. The main waves of the Arvanite migration into southern Greece started around 1300, reached a peak some time during the 14th century, and ended around 1600. Arvanites first reached Thessaly, then Attica and finally the Peloponnese (Clogg. 2002). Regarding the number of Arvanites in Greece, the 1951 census (the last census in Greece that included a question about language) gives a figure of 23.000 Arvaiithka speakers. Sociohinguistic research in the 1970s in the villages of Attica and Biotia alone indicated a figure of at least 30.000 speakers (Trudgill and Tzavaras 1977), while Lunden (1993) suggests 50.000 for Greece as a whole.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; They are Greek Orthodox Christians, and though they traditionally speak a dialect of [[Tosk Albanian]] known as [[Arvanitika]], they have fully assimilated into the Greek nation and do not identify as Albanians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall2829&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1997|pp=28–29}}. &quot;The permeability of ethnic boundaries is also demonstrated in many of the Greek villages of Attiki and Viotia (ancient Attika and Boiotia), where Arvanites often form a majority) These Arvanites are descended from Albanians who first entered Greece between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries (though there was a subsequent wave of immigration in the second half of the eighteenth century). Although still regarded as ethnically distinct in the nineteenth century, their participation in the Greek War of Independence and the Civil War has led to increasing assimilation: in a survey conducted in the 1970s, 97 per crnt of Arvanite informants despite regularly speaking in Arvanitika, considered themselves to be Greek. A similar concern with being identified as Greek is exhibited by the bilingual Arvanites of the Eastern Argolid.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bintliff137138&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bintliff|2003|pp=137–138}}. &quot;First, we can explain the astonishing persistence of Albanian village culture from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries through the ethnic and religious tolerance characteristic of Islamic empires and so lacking in their Christian equivalents. Ottoman control rested upon allowing local communities to keep their religion, language, local laws, and representatives, provided that taxes were paid (the millet system). There was no pressure for Greeks and Albanians to conform to each other's language or other behavior.
Clear signs of change are revealed in the travel diaries of the German scholar Ludwig Ross (1851), when he accompanied the Bavarian Otto, whom the Allies had foisted as king upon the newly freed Greek nation in the aftermath of the War of Independence in the 1830s. Ross praises the well-built Greek villages of central Greece with their healthy, happy, dancing inhabitants, and contrasts them specifically with the hovels and sickly inhabitants of Albanian villages. In fact, recent scholarship has underlined how far it was the West that built modem Greece in its own fanciful image as the land of a long-oppressed people who were the direct descendants of Pericles.
Thus from the late nineteenth century onward the children of the inhabitants of the new &quot;nation-state&quot; were taught in Greek, history confined itself to the episodes of pure Greekness, and the tolerant Ottoman attitude to cultural diversity yielded to a deliberate policy of total Hellenization of the populace—effective enough to fool the casual observer. One is rather amazed at the persistence today of such dual-speaking populations in much of the Albanian colonization zone. However, apart from the provinciality of this essentially agricultural province, a high rate of illiteracy until well into this century has also helped to preserve Arvanitika in the Boeotian villagers (Meijs 1993).&quot;; p. 140. &quot;In contrast therefore to the more openly problematic issue of Slav speakers in northern Greece, Arvanitic speakers in central Greece lack any signs of an assertive ethnicity. I would like to suggest that they possess what we might term a ''passive ethnicity''. As a result of a number of historical factors, much of the rural population in central Greece was Albanian-speaking by the time of the creation of the modern Greek state in the 1830s. Until this century, most of these people were illiterate and unschooled, yet there existed sufficient knowledge of Greek to communicate with officials and townspeople, itinerant traders, and so on, to limit the need to transform rural language usage. Life was extremely provincial, with just one major carriage-road passing through the center of the large province of Boeotia even in the 1930s (beyond which horseback and cart took over; van Effenterre 1989). Even in the 1960s, Arvanitic village children could be figures of fun for their Greek peers in the schools of Thebes (One of the two regional towns) (K. Sarri, personal communication, 2000). It was not a matter of cultural resistance but simple conservatism and provinciality, the extreme narrowness of rural life, that allowed Arvanitic language and local historic memories to survive so effectively to the very recent period.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VeremisKolipoulos2425&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Veremis|Kolipoulos|2003|pp=24–25}}. &quot;For the time being, the Greeks of free Greece could indulge in defining their brethren of unredeemed Greece, primarily the Slav Macedonians and secondarily the Orthodox Albanians and the Vlachs. Primary school students were taught, in the 1880s, that ‘Greeks [are] our kinsmen, of common descent, speaking the language we speak and professing the religion we profess’.&quot; But this definition, it seems, was reserved for small children who could not possibly understand the intricate arguments of their parents on the question of Greek identity. What was essential to understand at that tender age was that modern Greeks descended from the ancient Greeks. Grown up children, however, must have been no less confused than adults on the criteria for defining modern Greek identity. Did the Greeks constitute a ‘race’ apart from the Albanians, the Slavs and the Vlachs? Yes and no. High school students were told that the ‘other races’, i.e. the Slavs, the Albanians and the Vlachs, ‘having been Hellenized with the years in terms of mores and customs, are now being assimilated into the Greeks’. On the Slavs of Macedonia there seems to have been no consensus. Were they Bulgars, Slavicized Greeks or early Slavs? They ‘were’ Bulgars until the 1870s and Slavicized Greeks, or Hellenized Slavs subsequently, according to the needs of the dominant theory. There was no consensus, either, on the Vlachs. Were they Latinized Greek mountaineers of late immigrants from Vlachia? As in the case of the Slavs of Macedonia, Vlach descent shifted from the southern Balkans to the Danube, until the Romanians claimed the Vlachs for their brethren; which made the latter irrevocably indigenous to the southern Balkan mountains. The Albanians or ‘Arvanites’, were readily ‘adopted’ as brethren of common descent for at least three reasons. Firstly, the Albanians had been living in southern Greece, as far south as the Peloponnese, in considerable numbers. Secondly, Christian Albanians had fought with distinction and in considerable numbers in the War of Independence. Thirdly, credible Albanian claims for the establishment of an Albanian nation state materialized too Late for Greek national theorists to abandon well-entrenched positions. Commenting on a geography textbook for primary schools in 1901, a state committee found it inadequate and misleading. One of its principal shortcomings concerned the Albanians, who were described as ‘close kinsmen of the Greeks’. ‘These are unacceptable from the point of view of our national claims and as far as historical truth is concerned’, commented the committee. ‘it must have been maintained that they are of common descent with the Greeks (Pelasgians), that they speak a language akin to that of the Greeks and that they participated in all struggles for national liberation of the common fatherland.’&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Arvanitika is in a state of attrition due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population during the 20th century.

The [[Cham Albanians]] were a group that formerly inhabited a region of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] known as [[Chameria]], nowadays [[Thesprotia]] in northwestern Greece. Many Cham Albanians converted to Islam during the Ottoman era. [[Islam|Muslim]] Chams were [[Expulsion of Cham Albanians|expelled]] from Greece during [[World War II]], by an [[EDES|anti-communist resistance group]], as a result of their participation in a [[EAM-ELAS|communist resistance group]] and the [[Axis-Cham Albanian collaboration|collaboration]] with the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]], while Orthodox Chams have largely assimilated into the Greek nation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In [[Western Europe#CIA classification|Western Europe]], the Albanian population of approximately 10,000 people living in the [[Benelux countries]] is in comparison to other regions relatively limited. There are more than 6,000 Albanian people living in [[Belgium]] and 2,800 in the nearby [[Netherlands]]. The most lesser number of Albanian people in the Benelux region is to be found in [[Luxembourg]] with a population of 2,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stemplicht vreemdelingen 187 nationaliteiten in België |url=http://www.npdata.be/BuG/159-Verkiezingen-2012/Verkiezingen-2012.htm |website=npdata.be |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Netherlands&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Luxembourg&quot;/&gt;

The Albanian diaspora in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], in such countries as [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] or [[Turkey]], was predominantly formed during the Ottoman period through economic [[Human migration|migration]] and early years of the [[Republic of Turkey]] through migration due to sociopolitical discrimination and violence experienced by Albanians in [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GenisMaynard553555&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Geniş|Maynard|2009|pp=553–555}}. &quot;Taking a chronological perspective, the ethnic Albanians currently living in Turkey today could be categorized into three groups: Ottoman Albanians, Balkan Albanians, and twentieth century Albanians. The first category comprises descendants of Albanians who relocated to the Marmara and Aegean regions as part of the Ottoman Empire's administrative structure. Official Ottoman documents record the existence of Albanians living in and around Istanbul (Constantinople), Iznik (Nicaea), and Izmir (Smyrna). For example, between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries Albanian boys were brought to Istanbul and housed in Topkapı Palace as part of the ''devşirme'' system (an early Ottoman practice of human tribute required of Christian citizens) to serve as civil servants and Janissaries. In the 1600s Albanian seasonal workers were employed by these Albanian Janissaries in and around Istanbul and Iznik, and in 1860 Kayserili Ahmet, the governor of Izmir, employed Albanians to fight the raiding Zeybeks. Today, the descendants of Ottoman Albanians do not form a community per se, but at least some still identify as ethnically Albanian. However, it is unknown how many, if any, of these Ottoman Albanians retain Albanian language skills. The second category of ethnic Albanians living in modern Turkey is composed of people who are the descendants of refugees from the Balkans who because of war were forced to migrate inwards towards Eastern Thrace and Anatolia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as the Ottoman Empire dissolved. These Balkan Albanians are the largest group of ethnic Albanians living in Turkey today, and can be subcategorized into those who ended up in actual Albanian-speaking communities and those who were relocated into villages where they were the only Albanian-speaking migrants. Not surprisingly, the language is retained by some of the descendants from those of the former, but not those of the latter. The third category of ethnic Albanians in Turkey comprises recent or twentieth century migrants from the Balkans. These recent migrants can be subcategorized into those who came from Kosovo in the 1950s–1970s, those who came from Kosovo in 1999, and those who came from the Republic of Albania after 1992. All of these in the third category know a variety of modern Albanian and are mostly located in the western parts of Turkey in large metropolitan areas. Our research focuses on the history of migration and community formation of the Albanians located in the Samsun Province in the Black Sea region around 1912–1913 who would fall into the second category discussed above (see Figure 1). Turkish census data between 1927 and 1965 recorded the presence of Albanian speakers in Samsun Province, and the fieldwork we have been conducting in Samsun since September 2005 has revealed that there is still a significant number of Albanians living in the city and its surrounding region. According to the community leaders we interviewed, there are about 30,000–40,000 ethnic Albanian Turkish citizens in Samsun Province. The community was largely rural, located in the villages and engaged in agricultural activities until the 1970s. After this time, gradual migration to urban areas, particularly smaller towns and nearby cities has been observed. Long-distance rural-to-urban migration also began in later years mostly due to increasing demand for education and better jobs. Those who migrated to areas outside of Samsun Province generally preferred the cities located in the west of Turkey, particularly metropolitan areas such as Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa mainly because of the job opportunities as well as the large Albanian communities already residing in these cities. Today, the size of the Albanian community in Samsun Province is considered to be much smaller and gradually shrinking because of outward migration. Our observation is that the Albanians in Samsun seem to be fully integrated into Turkish society, and engaged in agriculture and small trading businesses. As education becomes accessible to the wider society and modernization accelerates transportation and hence communication of urban values, younger generations have also started to acquire professional occupations. Whilst a significant number of people still speak Albanian fluently as the language in the family, they have a perfect command of the Turkish language and cannot be distinguished from the rest of the population in terms of occupation, education, dress and traditions. In this article, we are interested in the history of this Albanian community in Samsun. Given the lack of any research on the Albanian presence in Turkey, our questions are simple and exploratory. When and where did these people come from? How and why did they choose Samsun as a site of resettlement? How did the socio- cultural characteristics of this community change over time? It is generally believed that the Albanians in Samsun Province are the descendants of the migrants and refugees from Kosovo who arrived in Turkey during the wars of 1912–13. Based on our research in Samsun Province, we argue that this information is partial and misleading. The interviews we conducted with the Albanian families and community leaders in the region and the review of Ottoman history show that part of the Albanian community in Samsun was founded through three stages of successive migrations. The first migration involved the forced removal of Muslim Albanians from the Sancak of Nish in 1878; the second migration occurred when these migrants’ children fled from the massacres in Kosovo in 1912–13 to Anatolia; and the third migration took place between 1913 and 1924 from the scattered villages in Central Anatolia where they were originally placed to the Samsun area in the Black Sea Region. Thus, the Albanian community founded in the 1920s in Samsun was in many ways a reassembling of the demolished Muslim Albanian community of Nish. This trajectory of the Albanian community of Nish shows that the fate of this community was intimately bound up with the fate of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and the socio-cultural composition of modern Turkey still carries on the legacy of its historical ancestor.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Turkey]], the exact numbers of the Albanian population of the country are difficult to correctly estimate. According to a 2008 report, there were approximately 1.300,000 people of Albanian descent living in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Milliyet, Türkiyedeki Kürtlerin Sayısı. 6 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As of that report, more than 500,000 Albanian descendants still recognise their [[ancestry]] and or their language, culture and traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamanheritage&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html Albanians in Turkey celebrate their cultural heritage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031102644/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html |date=31 October 2015 }}&quot;.

The first Albanian migration to [[North America]] began in the 19th and 20th centuries not long after gaining [[Declaration of independence of Albania|independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. However the [[Arbëreshë people]] from [[Southern Italy]] were the first Albanian people to arrive in the [[New World]], many of them migrating after the wars that accompanied the [[Risorgimento]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Towns of Our Italian Ancestors Our ancestors Italo-Albanian history |url=http://www.vatrarberesh.it/bibliot…/ebooks/italoalbanian.pdf |website=vatrarberesh.it |page=1 |language=English }}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Stefano Fiorini, Giuseppe Tagarelli, Alessio Boattini, Donata Luiselli, Anna Piro, Antonio Tagarelli, Davide Pettener |title=Ethnicity and Evolution of the Biodemographic Structure of Arbëreshe and Italian Populations of the Pollino Area, southern Italy (1820–1984) |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249423568 |website=researchgate.net |language=English |date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then several Albanian migration waves have occurred throughout the 20th century as for instance after the [[Second World War]] with Albanians mostly from [[Yugoslavia]] rather than from [[Communist Albania]], then after the [[Fall of communism in Albania|Breakup of Communist Albania]] in 1990 and finally following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/albanians/ &quot;Albanians&quot;].

Italy's [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexation]] of Albania and its alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] against the allies marked a difficult time for Albanian and Italian Australians as they were thought by Australian authorities to pose a fascist threat. However, the number of Albanian immigrants slowed consequently during that time but also due to immigration restrictions placed by the [[Communism in Albania|communist regime]] in Albania.

The traditional [[Albanian cuisine|cuisine]] of the Albanians is diverse and has been greatly influenced by their [[tradition]]s, their varied [[Biophysical environment|environment]] in the [[Balkans]] and their turbulent [[history]] throughout the course of the centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanun&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mirjona SADIKU|title=Page 1 A Tradition of Honor, Hospitality and Blood Feuds:Exploring the Kanun Customary Law inContemporary Albania.|url=http://js.ugd.edu.mk/index.php/BSSR/article/view/861/833|website=js.ugd.edu.mk|pages=11–14|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enjoyment of [[food]] had and has a high priority in the lives of the Albanians especially when it comes to celebrating [[religious festival]]s such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], [[Hanukkah]], [[Novruz]] or [[Ramadan]].
  
Albanian cuisine is different from region to another and each Albanian speaking territory preserves a distinctive [[regional cuisine]] characterised by local specialties and different styles within the Albanian cuisine. There is a considerable diversity between the [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[Greek cuisine|Greek]]-influenced cuisines of the [[Arbëreshë people#Cuisine|Arbëreshë]]s and [[Cham Albanians#Cuisine|Cham]]s as well as of the [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]]-influenced cuisines of the Albanians in the [[Balkans]].
 
Among the essential characteristics in Albanian cuisine is undoubtedly the generous use of a wide range of ingredients and spices specific to their locations. It includes many varieties of [[fruit]]s such as [[Lemon (fruit)|lemon]]s, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[Figs (fruit)|fig]]s and [[Olive (fruit)|olive]]s. [[Spice]]s and other [[herb]]s such as [[Basil (herb)|basil]], [[lavender]], [[Spearmint|mint]], [[oregano]], [[rosemary]] and [[thyme]] are also used, as are [[vegetable]]s such as [[garlic]]s, [[onion]]s, [[Bell pepper|pepper]]s, [[potato]]es and [[tomato]]es.

The Albanian diet, for those Albanians who lives closer to the sea and lakes, are able to complement their diet with fresh and saltwater [[fish]], [[shellfish]] and other [[seafood]] specialities from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Ohrid Lake]]. Otherwise, [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] is often considered as the traditional [[meat]] for different [[religious festival]]s and [[poultry]], [[beef]] and [[pork]] are also in plentiful supply.

In Albania, [[Tavë Kosi]] is a national dish consisting of garlicky lamb and rice baked under a thick, tart veil of [[yogurt]]. Fërgesë is another national dish and is made up with peppers, tomatoes and [[cottage cheese]]. Another beloved dish in Albania and other Albanian-speaking territories is called Pite which is generally a filled and baked pastry with a filling of a mixture of [[spinach]] and [[curd|gjizë]] or [[Ground meat|mish]]. Also famous is [[Flia]] consisting of multiple crepe-like layers brushed with crea. Petulla, a traditionally fried dough, and Krofne, similar to [[Berliner (doughnut)|Berliner]], constitute as well a popular speciality in Albanian cuisine.

The roots of [[Albanian literature|literature of the Albanian people]] can be traced to the [[Middle Ages]] with surviving works about [[history]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] dating from the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie332&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Elsie|title=Albanian Literature: A Short History|publisher=I.B.Tauris, 2005|isbn=9781845110314|pages=3–32|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Theodor+of+Shkodra#v=onepage&amp;q=Theodor%20of%20Shkodra&amp;f=false|language=English|date=29 July 2005|author1-link=Robert Elsie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known use of written Albanian is a [[Formula e pagëzimit|baptismal formula]] (1462) written by the Archbishop of Durrës [[Paulus Angelus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555, a Catholic clergyman [[Gjon Buzuku]] from the Shestan region published the earliest known book written in Albanian titled ''[[Meshari]]'' (The Missal) regarding Catholic prayers and rites containing archaic medieval language, lexemes and expressions obsolete in contemporary Albanian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie914&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=9–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian clergy such as [[Luca Matranga]] in the Arbëresh diaspora published (1592) in the Tosk dialect while other notable authors were from northern Albanian lands and included [[Pjetër Budi]], [[Frang Bardhi]], and [[Pjetër Bogdani]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie1417212430&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=14–21, 24–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and onwards, important contributions to Albanian literature were made by the [[Arbëreshë people]] of [[Southern Italy]] who played an influential role in encouraging the [[Albanian Renaissance]]. Notable among them was figures such as [[Demetrio Camarda]], [[Gabriele Dara]], [[Girolamo de Rada]], [[Giulio Variboba]] and [[Giuseppe Serembe]] who produced inspiring nationalist literature and worked to systematise the [[Albanian language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie4464&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=44–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bejtexhinj]] in the 18th century emerged as the result of the influences of [[Islam]] and particularly [[Bektashi Order|Sufism]] orders moving towards [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie3643&quot;/&gt; Individuals such as [[Nezim Frakulla]], [[Hasan Zyko Kamberi]], [[Shahin Frashëri|Shahin]] and [[Dalip Frashëri]] compiled literature infused with expressions, language and themes on the circumstances of the time, the insecurities of the future and their discontent at the conditions of the feudal system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie3643&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=36–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Albanian Renaissance]] in the 19th century is remarkable both for its valuable poetic achievement and for its variety within the Albanian literature. It drew on the ideas of [[Romanticism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] characterised by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as the interaction between nature and mankind. [[Dora d'Istria]], [[Girolamo de Rada]], [[Naim Frashëri]], [[Naum Veqilharxhi]], [[Sami Frashëri]] and [[Pashko Vasa]] maintained this movement and are remembered today for composing series of prominent works.

The Albanian people have incorporated various natural materials from their local [[agriculture]] and [[livestock]] as a vital source for [[attire]], [[clothing]] and [[fabric]]s. Their [[Albanian national clothing|traditional apparel]] was primarily influenced by [[nature]], the [[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]] and has been continuously changed since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lazWAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=brez+clothing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZlMDggfvJAhVMdD4KHQY_DpUQ6AEIMTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=moons%2C%20stars%2C%20and%20snakes&amp;f=false| page=16| title=Encyclopedia of National Dress: Traditional Clothing Around the World| chapter=Albania| publisher=ABC-CLIO| year=2013|isbn= 9780313376368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the Albanian regions possesses their own exceptional clothing traditions and peculiarities varied occasionally in colour, material and shape.
 
The [[traditional costume]] of Albanian men includes a white [[Skirt (garment)|skirt garment]] called [[Fustanella]], a white shirt with wide [[sleeve]]s, and a thin black [[jacket]] or [[vest]], such as the [[Xhamadan]] or Xhurdia. In winter, they add a warm [[woolen]] coat or [[fur]] coat known as Flokata or Dollama made from [[sheepskin]] or [[goat]] fur. Another authentic piece is called Tirq which is a tight pair of felt [[trousers]] mostly white, sometimes dark brown or black.

The Albanian women's costumes are much more complicated, more colorful, richer in ornamentation and elaborate than that costume of the Albanian men. In all the Albanian regions the women's clothing often has been decorated with [[filigree]] [[ironwork]], colorful embroidery, a lot of symbols and vivid accessories. A unique and ancient dress is called [[Xhubleta]], a bell shaped skirt reaching down to the calves and worn from the shoulders with two shoulder straps at the upper part.&lt;ref name=&quot;dtk.rks-gov.net&quot;&gt;http://dtk.rks-gov.net/tkk_objekti_en.aspx?id=9827&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PulahaMansaku1982&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Selami Pulaha|author2=Seit Mansaku|author3-link=Andromaqi Gjergji|author3=Andromaqi Gjergji|title=Shqiptarët dhe trojet e tyre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZ9IAQAAIAAJ|year=1982|publisher=8 Nëntori|pages=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Albanian [[headdress]]es remain a contrasting and recognisable feature of Albanian traditional clothing. Albanian men traditionally wore hats of various designs, shape and size. A very common headgear is a [[Qeleshe|Plis]] and Qylafë, in contrast, Albanian women wore a Kapica adorned with jewels or embroidery on the forehead, and a Lëvere or Kryqe which usually covers the head, shoulders and neck. Wealthy Albanian women wore headdresses embellished with gems, gold or silver.

Different traditional handmade [[shoe]]s and [[sock]]s were worn by the Albanian people. The leather shoes called [[Opinga]] were made from rough animal skin and worn with knitted woolen socks known as [[Çorape]] worked either in wool or cotton.

There are a number of international acclaimed singers of Albanian origin across the world such as [[Action Bronson]], [[Ava Max]], [[Bebe Rexha]], [[Dua Lipa]], [[Era Istrefi]], [[Gashi (rapper)|Gashi]] and [[Rita Ora]].

In the [[medieval era]], prior to the arrival of [[Islam in Albania|Islam]] into the Albanian inhabited lands, Christianity was the predominant religion among the Albanians. They were mostly following [[Orthodoxy in Albania|Orthodox]] traditions and practices until the middle of the 13th century as [[Gheg Albanian]]s began to convert to [[Catholicism in Albania|Catholicism]] as a mean to resist the oppression of the [[Slavs]].{{efn|See:&lt;ref&gt;Comnena, Anna.

During the [[modern era]], the [[monarchy]] and [[communism]] in [[Albania]] as well as the [[socialism]] in Kosovo, historically part of [[Yugoslavia]], followed a systematic [[secularisation]] of its people. This policy was chiefly applied within the borders of both territories and produced a secular majority of its population.

All forms of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and other religious practices were prohibited except for old non-institutional [[pagan]] practices in the rural areas, which were seen as identifying with the national culture. The current Albanian state has revived some pagan festivals, such as the [[Spring Day|Spring]] festival ({{lang-sq|Dita e Verës}}) held yearly on 14 March in the city of [[Elbasan]].

The communist regime which ruled Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions, and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first [[state atheism|atheist state]]. Religious freedom returned to Albania following the regime's change in 1992. Albanian Sunni Muslims are found throughout the country, [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox Christians]] as well as [[Bektashi]]s are concentrated in the south, while Roman Catholics are found primarily in the north of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;International Religious Freedom Report 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |title=Albania: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=State.gov|date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Albania, 58.79% of the population adheres to Islam, making it the largest religion in the country. Christianity is practiced by 16.99% of the population, making it the second largest religion in the country. The remaining population is either [[irreligious]] or belongs to other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.instat.gov.al/media/177358/njoftim_per_media_-_fjala_e_drejtorit_te_instat_ines_nurja_per_rezultatet_finale_te_census_2011.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326091156/http://www.instat.gov.al/media/177358/njoftim_per_media_-_fjala_e_drejtorit_te_instat_ines_nurja_per_rezultatet_finale_te_census_2011.pdf|url-status=dead|title=2011 Albanian Census|archivedate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before World War II, there was given a distribution of 70% Muslims, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/al.html |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |title=The World Factbook: Albania |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Gallup Global Reports 2010 shows that religion plays a role in the lives of only 39% of Albanians, and ranks Albania the thirteenth least religious country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/Gallup-Global-Reports.aspx |title=Gallup Global Reports |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=25 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014034457/http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/Gallup-Global-Reports.aspx |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For part of its history, [[History of the Jews in Albania|Albania has also had a Jewish community]]. Members of the Jewish community were saved by a group of Albanians during the Nazi occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarner1997&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sarner|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many left for Israel c. 1990–1992 when the borders were opened after the fall of the communist regime, but about 200 Jews still live in Albania.

The '''Association for Computing Machinery''' ('''ACM''') is a US-based international [[learned society]] for [[computing]]. It was founded in 1947, and is the world's largest scientific and educational [[computing]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/20613.html |title=Indiana University Media Relations |publisher=indiana.edu |accessdate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACM is a [[nonprofit organization|non-profit]] professional membership group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do?ein1=&amp;names=%22association+for+computing+machinery%22&amp;city=&amp;state=All...&amp;country=US&amp;deductibility=all&amp;dispatchMethod=searchCharities&amp;submitName=Search |title=ACM 501(c)3 Status as a group |publisher=irs.gov |accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming nearly 100,000 student and professional members {{as of|2019|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-benefits|title=Membership Benefits|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contact Information |url=https://www.acm.org/about-acm/contact-us |website=www.acm.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACM is an [[umbrella organization]] for academic and scholarly interests in [[computer science]]. Its motto is &quot;Advancing Computing as a Science &amp; Profession&quot;.

==History==
The ACM was founded in 1947 under the name ''Eastern Association for Computing Machinery'', which was changed the following year to the Association for Computing Machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-history|title=ACM History|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
[[File:1601Broadway.jpg|thumb|ACM headquarters are located at 1601 Broadway, Times Square, New York City.]]
ACM is organized into over 171 local chapters and 37 [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs), through which it conducts most of its activities. Additionally, there are over 500 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]].

Many of the SIGs, such as [[ACM SIGGRAPH|SIGGRAPH]], [[SIGDA]], [[SIGPLAN]], [[SIGCSE]] and [[SIGCOMM]], sponsor regular conferences, which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields. The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.

ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] (ICPC), and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between [[Garry Kasparov]] and the [[IBM Deep Blue]] computer.

===Publications===
{{main cat|Association for Computing Machinery publications}}
ACM publishes over 50 journals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/publications/journals|title=Journals &amp; Magazines|work=acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the prestigious&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul Benjamin |last1=Lowry |first2=Denton |last2=Romans |first3=Aaron |last3=Curtis |title=Global Journal Prestige and Supporting Disciplines: A Scientometric Study of Information Systems Journals |journal=[[Journal of the Association for Information Systems]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=29–80 |year=2004 |ssrn=666145|doi=10.17705/1jais.00045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Journal of the ACM]]'', and two general magazines for computer professionals, ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' (also known as ''Communications'' or ''CACM'') and ''[[ACM Queue|Queue]]''. Other publications of the ACM include:
*''[[XRDS (magazine)|ACM XRDS]]'', formerly &quot;Crossroads&quot;, was redesigned in 2010 and is the most popular student computing magazine in the US.
*''[[ACM Interactions (magazine)|ACM Interactions]]'', an interdisciplinary HCI publication focused on the connections between experiences, people and technology, and the third largest ACM publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Wakkary | first1 = R.| last2 = Stolterman | first2 = E.| doi = 10.1145/1897239.1897240| title = WELCOME: Our first interactions | journal = Interactions| volume = 18| pages = 5| year = 2011| pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[ACM Computing Surveys]]'' (CSUR)
*''[[Computers in Entertainment]]'' (CIE)
*''[[ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems]]'' (JETC) 
*''ACM Special Interest Group: Computers and Society'' (SIGCAS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Home page | url= http://www.sigcas.org/newsletter | website = sigcas.org | publisher= Association for Computing Machinery | access-date = 28 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A number of journals, specific to subfields of computer science, titled ''ACM Transactions''. Some of the more notable transactions include:
**''ACM Transactions on Computer Systems'' (TOCS)
**''[[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics]]'' (TCBB)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Computational Logic]]'' (TOCL)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction]]'' (TOCHI)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Database Systems]]'' (TODS)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Graphics]]'' (TOG)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software]]'' (TOMS)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications]]'' (TOMM)
**''[[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking]]'' (TON)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems]]'' (TOPLAS)

Although ''Communications'' no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages.

ACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid [[subscriber]]s online at its [[#Digital Library|Digital Library]] and also has a [[ACM Guide to Computing Literature|Guide to Computing Literature]]. Individual members additionally have access to [[Safari Books Online]] and Books24x7. ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members.

In 1997, ACM Press published ''Wizards and Their Wonders: Portraits in Computing'' ({{ISBN|0897919602}}), written by Christopher Morgan, with new photographs by [[Louis Fabian Bachrach, Jr.|Louis Fabian Bachrach]]. The book is a collection of historic and current portrait photographs of figures from the computer industry.

==&lt;span id=&quot;Portal&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Digital Library&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Portal and Digital Library==
The '''ACM Portal''' is an online service of the ACM.&lt;ref name=portal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/|title=ACM Digital Library|work=acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its core are two main sections: '''ACM Digital Library''' and the '''[[ACM Guide to Computing Literature]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libs.uga.edu/research/subject/computer-science The University of Georgia Guide to Online Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACM Digital Library is the full-text collection of all articles published by the ACM in its articles, magazines and conference proceedings. The Guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries.&lt;ref name=portal/&gt;
The ACM Digital Library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organization's journals, magazines, newsletters and conference proceedings. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest. There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature. This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature.

ACM adopted a hybrid [[Open access|Open Access]] (OA) publishing model in 2013. Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://authors.acm.org/ | title=ACM Author Rights |publisher=Acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACM was a &quot;green&quot; publisher before the term was invented. Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Library's permanently maintained Version of Record.

All metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world, including [[abstracts]], linked references and citing works, citation and usage statistics, as well as all functionality and services. Other than the free articles, the full-texts are accessed by subscription.

There is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement. Some authors see a centralized peer&amp;ndash;review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like [[arXiv]]. Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as ''[[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research]]'', ''[[Journal of Machine Learning Research]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology]]''.

==Membership grades==
{{main cat|Members of the Association for Computing Machinery}}
In addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and &quot;demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ |title=ACM Senior Members–An Overview |publisher=Acm.org |access-date=November 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118200303/http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Fellows, Distinguished Members, and Senior Members cannot exceed 1%, 10%, and 25% of the total number of professional members, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://awards.acm.org/advanced-member-grades]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fellows===
{{main|ACM Fellow}}
{{main list|List of Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery}}
The [[ACM Fellow]]s Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 &quot;to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM.&quot; There are 1163 Fellows {{as of|2019|lc=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.acm.org/fellow/all.cfm |title=List of ACM Fellows |publisher=Awards.acm.org |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of about 100,000 members.

===Distinguished Members===
In 2006, ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades, one which was called Distinguished Members. Distinguished Members (Distinguished Engineers, Distinguished Scientists, and Distinguished Educators) have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership and &quot;have made a significant impact on the computing field&quot;. Note that in 2006 when the Distinguished Members first came out, one of the three levels was called &quot;Distinguished Member&quot; and was changed about two years later to &quot;Distinguished Educator&quot;. Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles.

===Senior Members===
Also in 2006, ACM began recognizing Senior Members. According to the ACM, &quot;The Senior Members Grade recognizes those ACM members with at least 10 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous Professional Membership who have demonstrated performance through technical leadership, and technical or professional contributions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://awards.acm.org/senior-members ACM Senior Members]&lt;/ref&gt; Senior membership also requires 3 letters of reference

===Distinguished Speakers===
While not technically a membership grade, the ACM recognizes distinguished speakers on topics in computer science. A distinguished speaker is appointed for a three-year period. There are usually about 125 current distinguished speakers. The ACM website describes these people as 'Renowned International Thought Leaders'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://speakers.acm.org/ |title = Homepage|website = ACM Distinguished Speakers|publisher = Association for Computing Machinery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguished speaker program is overseen by a committee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://speakers.acm.org/committee| title = ACM Speakers Committee|website = ACM Distinguished Speakers|publisher = Association for Computing Machinery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapters==
ACM has three kinds of chapters: [[Special Interest Group]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acm.org/sigs | title=ACM Special Interest Groups | accessdate=August 7, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727190450/http://www.acm.org/sigs | archivedate=July 27, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional Chapters, and [[ACM Student Chapter|Student Chapters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acm.org/chapters/ | title=ACM Chapters | accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2011}}, ACM has professional &amp; SIG Chapters in 56 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Conferences==
{{main cat|Association for Computing Machinery conferences}}
ACM and its Special Interest Groups (SIGs) sponsors numerous conferences with 170 hosted worldwide in 2017. [http://www.acm.org/conferences ACM Conferences page] has an up-to-date complete list while a partial list is shown below. Most of the SIGs also have an annual conference. ACM conferences are often very popular publishing venues and are therefore very competitive. For example, the 2007 [[SIGGRAPH]] conference attracted about 30000 visitors, and CIKM only accepted 15% of the long papers that were submitted in 2005.

==Cooperation==
ACM's primary partner has been the [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE-CS), which is the largest subgroup of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical [[computer science]], but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda. They have many joint activities including conferences, publications and awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACM / IEEE-CS Cooperation — Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101141809/http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop|archive-date=January 1, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACM and its SIGs co-sponsor about 20 conferences each year with IEEE-CS and other parts of IEEE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACM / IEEE-CS Jointly Sponsored Conferences —Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/conferences|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101141814/http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/conferences|archive-date=January 1, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eckert-Mauchly Award]] and [[Ken Kennedy Award]], both major awards in computer science, are given jointly by ACM and the IEEE-CS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACM / IEEE-CS Joint Awards — Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/awards|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143733/http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/awards|archive-date=April 6, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534860 |title=Computer Science Curricula 2013: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science|author1 = Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula|author2 = Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)|author3 = IEEE Computer Society|authorlink3=IEEE Computer Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACM has also jointly sponsored on events with other professional organizations like the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIAM: ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA17)|url=https://www.siam.org/meetings/da17/|website=www.siam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility==
The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct&lt;ref&gt;https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics&lt;/ref&gt; lays out codes of behavior for ACM members in their professional and personal conduct. The Code is conveyed under four general categories: General Ethical Principles, Professional Responsibilities, Professional Leadership Principles and Compliance with the Code:

*General Ethical Principles

:The Code indicates that computing professionals should acknowledge their work contributes to societal well-being and that all people are impacted by the work of computing professionals. In addition, the Code calls on computing professionals to be obliged to ensure their work, both individually and collectively, benefits all of society, including respecting diversity and environmental sustainability.

:The Code also calls on computing professionals to avoid harm in their professional and personal lives. Harm can be unintended or not, and can be physical, mental, involve disclosure of information, destruction of property, reputation or the environment. Actions should be taken to mitigate harm and to remedy any unintended harm that occurs do to computing professional work. Risk of computing systems causing harm should also be reported and actively mitigated upon discovery.

:The Code calls on computing professionals to be honest and trustworthy. This include being forthright when a job or task calls on skills not readily known to the computing professional, and respecting organizational agency.

:The Code calls on computing professionals to not discriminate. Discrimination is broadly defined, including &quot;discrimination on the basis of age, color, disability, ethnicity, family status, gender identity, labor union membership, military status, nationality, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, or any other inappropriate factor is an explicit violation of the Code.&quot; Efforts to mitigate the consequences of discrimination should be made when discrimination occurs.

:The Code calls on computing professionals to respect privacy, and should use de-identification and anonymization methods on data when appropriate. Measures to prevent unauthorized data access should also be used. Furthermore, only the minimum amount of data needed to complete the task should be collected, and individuals should retain agency for how their data is used at all times. In a similar vein computing professionals should respect confidentiality when applicable.
 
*Professional Responsibilities

:Computing professionals should strive for high work quality, both in terms of work process and work result. In that vein, computing professionals should strive to expand their capabilities and competencies both for themselves and the teams in which they operate. As rules for professional work differ from industry to industry, it is important that computing professionals know and respect these rules while maintaining a grounding in ethical conduct.

:Computing professionals are often occasioned to review the work of others and have their work reviewed. This is a normal part of establishing a high level of work product, and computing professionals should seek such review. It is incumbent on computing professionals to provide comprehensive review of the work of others, both for the actual work and for anything missing (such as ignored risks or impacts) from the work. Computing professionals should also only perform work in which they have an area of competence, and only review the work of others in which they have said competence.

:Computing professionals also have an affirmative duty to foster public awareness and understanding of the risks and advantages of their work. Such efforts should consider the public's existing understanding, and seek to generate an environment conducive to public engagement.

:Computing professionals should only access computing and communication resources when authorized or compelled by the public interest. Many data resources reside in unsecured systems, yet their presence in an accessible format is not justification in itself to access them. Similarly computing professionals should design and implement systems that are sufficiently secure, and consider the risks of data being made public when determining what systems to implement to ensure data security.

*Professional Leadership Principles

:Computing professionals in a positions of leadership has elevated responsibilities, both to society and to the people and organizations that they lead. The public good is a primary concern, and should seek to make public good considerations explicitly considered in their projects and work. As a leader, computing professionals should evaluate progress toward the social good in their projects and work, and seek to engage other computing professionals toward the same.

:Computing professional leaders should also seek to improve the quality of life for themselves and the people and organizations they lead. This includes physical, mental and emotional well-being, but also seeking out educational and developmental opportunities. This should be done for technical skills, but also for ethical conduct.

:Computing professional leaders should seek to integrate ethical considerations into automated systems and processes, and take especial care when retiring old systems or dealing with systems with the potential to become integrated with the infrastructure of society. Planning for transition of such systems, and allowing time for society to adapt to the new systems, should be undertaken.

*Compliance With the Code

:Establishing a positive future for computing depends on both technical and ethical elevation of the field. Computing professionals should adhere to these principles and should take reasonable actions to ensure the code is operationalized in practice. This includes expressing concern to colleagues and people possibly violating the Code.

:Violations of the Code should be reviewed by other computing professionals, not necessarily members of the ACM. Appropriate remedial action as determined by those professionals and as proscribed in the ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct Enforcement Policy should implemented as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/enforcement-procedures&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anabaptism''' (from [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] {{lang|la|anabaptista}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Anabaptist, n.|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=December 2012|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/6865|access-date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀναβαπτισμός}}: {{lang|grc|ἀνά-}} &quot;re-&quot; and {{lang|grc|βαπτισμός}} &quot;[[baptism]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Anabaptism, n.|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=December 2012|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/6864|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-de|Täufer}}, earlier also {{lang|de|Wiedertäufer}}&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Since the middle of the 20th century, the German-speaking world no longer uses the term {{lang|de|Wiedertäufer}} (translation: &quot;Re-baptizers&quot;), considering it biased. The term {{lang|de|Täufer}} (translation: &quot;Baptizers&quot;) is now used, which is considered more impartial. From the perspective of their persecutors, the &quot;Baptizers&quot; baptized for the second time those &quot;who as infants had already been baptized&quot;. The denigrative term Anabaptist signifies rebaptizing and is considered a polemical term, so it has been dropped from use in modern German. However, in the English-speaking world, it is still used to distinguish the Baptizers more clearly from the [[Baptists]], a Protestant sect that developed later in England. Compare their self-designation as &quot;Brethren in Christ&quot; or &quot;Church of God&quot;: {{cite encyclopedia |last=Stayer |first=James M. |author-link=James M.

The movement is generally seen as an offshoot of [[Protestantism]], although this view has been challenged by some Anabaptists.{{Sfn | Klaassen | 1973}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url = http://www.cbc4me.org/articles/Baptist/04-McGrath.pdf | format = PDF | title= The Anabaptists: Neither Catholic nor Protestant | first = William | last = McGrath | location = Hartville, OH | publisher = The Fellowship Messenger | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227060547/http://www.cbc4me.org/articles/Baptist/04-McGrath.pdf | archive-date=December 27, 2016 | url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url = http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/15.html | title = Renaissance and Reformation | chapter = The Radicals of the Reformation | first = William | last = Gilbert | date = 1998 | location = Lawrence, KS | publisher = University of Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 4 million Anabaptists live in the world today with adherents scattered across all inhabited continents. In addition to a number of minor Anabaptist groups, the most numerous include the [[Mennonites]] at 2.1&amp;nbsp;million, the [[German Baptists]] at 1.5&amp;nbsp;million, the [[Amish]] at 300,000 and the [[Hutterites]] at 50,000.{{citation needed lead|date=September 2019}}

In the 21st century there are large cultural differences between assimilated Anabaptists, who do not differ much from [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] or [[mainline Protestant]]s, and traditional groups like the Amish, the [[Old Colony Mennonites]], the [[Old Order Mennonite]]s, the Hutterites and the [[Old German Baptist Brethren]].

This [[believer's baptism]] is opposed to [[infant baptism|baptism of infants]], who are not able to make a conscious decision to be baptized. Anabaptists are those who are in a traditional line with the early Anabaptists of the 16th century. Other Christian groups with different roots also practice believer's baptism, such as [[Baptists]], but these groups are not seen as Anabaptist. The Amish, Hutterites, and Mennonites are direct descendants of the early Anabaptist movement. [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Bruderhof]], and the [[Apostolic Christian Church]] are considered later developments among the Anabaptists.

The name Anabaptist means &quot;one who baptizes again&quot;. Their persecutors named them this, referring to the practice of baptizing persons when they converted or declared their faith in Christ, even if they had been baptized as infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anabaptist | title = Online Etymological Dictionary | origyear = 2001 | year = 2010 | first = Douglas | last = Harper | contribution = Anabaptist | accessdate = April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make a confession of faith that is freely chosen and so rejected baptism of infants. The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist, claiming that infant baptism was not part of scripture and was therefore null and void. They said that baptizing self-confessed believers was their first true baptism:
{{quote |text=I have never taught Anabaptism.... But the right baptism of Christ, which is preceded by teaching and oral confession of faith, I teach, and say that infant baptism is a robbery of the right baptism of Christ. |author=[[Balthasar Hubmaier|Hubmaier, Balthasar]] (1526) |source=''[[s:Balthasar Hübmaier/Chapter 6#204|Short apology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vedder |first=Henry Clay |author-link=Henry Clay Vedder |title=[[s:Balthasar Hübmaier|Balthasar Hübmaier: the Leader of the Anabaptists]] |location=New York |publisher=[[G.

Anabaptists were heavily and long persecuted starting in the 16th century by both [[Magisterial Reformation|Magisterial Protestants]] and [[Roman Catholics]], largely because of their interpretation of scripture which put them at odds with official state church interpretations and with government. Anabaptism was never [[State religion|established by any state]] and therefore never enjoyed any associated privileges. Most Anabaptists adhered to a [[Sermon on the Mount#Analysis and interpretation|literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount]] which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government. Some groups who practiced rebaptism, now extinct, believed otherwise and complied with these requirements of civil society.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;For example, those of the [[Münster Rebellion]] or [[Balthasar Hubmaier]].&lt;/ref&gt; They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, and some historians consider them outside true Anabaptism. [[Conrad Grebel]] wrote in a letter to [[Thomas Müntzer]] in 1524:
{{quote |True Christian believers are sheep among wolves, sheep for the slaughter...  Neither do they use worldly sword or war, since all killing has ceased with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dyck&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb | Dyck | 1967 |p = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Medieval forerunners ===
{{main|Proto-Protestantism}}
Anabaptists are considered to have begun with the Radical Reformers in the 16th century, but historians classify certain people and groups as their forerunners because of a similar approach to the interpretation and application of the Bible. For instance, [[Petr Chelčický]], a 15th-century [[Bohemia]]n reformer, taught most of the beliefs considered integral to Anabaptist theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Wagner | first= Murray L | title= Petr Chelčický: A Radical Separatist in Hussite Bohemia | place=Scottdale, PA | publisher=Herald Press | year=1983 | ISBN=0-8361-1257-1 | page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval antecedents may include the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], the [[Hussite]]s, Dutch Sacramentists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/S2384.html | last = van der Zijpp | first = Nanne|title= Sacramentists|publisher= Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|accessdate=April 12, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070227094841/http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/S2384.html | archivedate= February 27, 2007 | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fontaine |first=Piet FM |title=The Light and the Dark: A Cultural History of Dualism |place=Utrecht |publisher=Gopher Publishers |year=2006 |volume=XXIII.

The [[Waldensian]]s also represent a faith similar to the Anabaptists.{{Sfn | van Braght | 1950 | p = 277}}

Medieval dissenters and Anabaptists who held to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount share in common the following affirmations:
* The believer must not swear oaths or refer disputes between believers to law-courts for resolution, in accordance with {{Bibleref2|1Co|6:1–11||1 Corinthians 6:1–11}}.
* The believer must not bear arms or offer forcible resistance to wrongdoers, nor wield the sword. No Christian has the ''[[jus gladii]]'' (the right of the sword). {{Bibleref2 |Matt|5:39||Matthew 5:39}}
* Civil government (i.e. &quot;[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]&quot;) belongs to the world. The believer belongs to God's kingdom, so must not fill any office nor hold any rank under government, which is to be passively obeyed. {{Bibleref2|John|18:36||John 18:36}} {{Bibleref2|Rom|13:1–7||Romans 13:1–7}}
* Sinners or unfaithful ones are to be excommunicated, and excluded from the sacraments and from intercourse with believers unless they repent, according to {{Bibleref2|1Co|5:9–13||1 Corinthians 5:9–13}} and {{Bibleref2|Matt|18:15||Matthew 18:15 seq.}}, but no force is to be used towards them.

=== Zwickau prophets and the German Peasants' War ===
{{Main|Thomas Müntzer|Zwickau prophets|German Peasants' War}}
[[File:Titelblatt 12 Artikel.jpg|thumb|upright|Twelve Articles of the Peasants pamphlet of 1525]]
On December 27, 1521, [[Zwickau prophets|three &quot;prophets&quot;]] appeared in [[Wittenberg]] from [[Zwickau]] who were influenced by (and, in turn, influencing) [[Thomas Müntzer]]—Thomas Dreschel, [[Nicholas Storch]], and Mark Thomas Stübner. They preached an apocalyptic, radical alternative to Lutheranism. Their preaching helped to stir the feelings concerning the social crisis which erupted in the [[German Peasants' War]] in southern Germany in 1525 as a revolt against feudal oppression. Under the leadership of Müntzer, it became a war against all constituted authorities and an attempt to establish by revolution an ideal Christian commonwealth, with absolute equality among persons and the community of goods. The Zwickau prophets were not Anabaptists (that is, they did not practise &quot;rebaptism&quot;); nevertheless, the prevalent social inequities and the preaching of men such as these have been seen as laying the foundation for the Anabaptist movement. The social ideals of the Anabaptist movement coincided closely with those of leaders in the German Peasants' War. Studies have found a very low percentage of subsequent sectarians to have taken part in the peasant uprising.{{Sfn | Stayer | 1994}}

=== Views on origins ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Research on the origins of the Anabaptists has been tainted both by the attempts of their enemies to slander them and by the attempts of their supporters to vindicate them. It was long popular to classify all Anabaptists as Munsterites and radicals associated with the Zwickau prophets, [[Jan Matthys]], [[John of Leiden]], and Thomas Müntzer. Those desiring to correct this error tended to over-correct and deny all connections between the larger Anabaptist movement and the most radical elements.

The modern era of Anabaptist historiography arose with Roman Catholic scholar [[Carl Adolf Cornelius]]' publication of ''Die Geschichte des Münsterischen Aufruhrs'' (The History of the Münster Uprising) in 1855. Baptist historian [[Albert Henry Newman]] (1852–1933), who [[Harold S. Bender]] said occupied &quot;first position in the field of American Anabaptist historiography&quot;, made a major contribution with his ''A History of Anti-Pedobaptism'' (1897).

Three main theories on origins of the Anabaptists are the following:
* The movement began in a single expression in [[Zürich]] and spread from there (Monogenesis);
* It developed through several independent movements ([[polygenism|polygenesis]]); and
* It was a continuation of true New Testament Christianity ([[apostolic succession]] or church perpetuity).

==== Monogenesis ====
A number of scholars (e.g. Harold S. Bender, William Estep, Robert Friedmann{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}) consider the Anabaptist movement to have developed from the [[Swiss Brethren]] movement of [[Conrad Grebel]], [[Felix Manz]], [[George Blaurock]], et al. They generally held that Anabaptism had its origins in [[Zürich]], and that the Anabaptism of the Swiss Brethren was transmitted to southern Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, where it developed into its various branches.  The monogenesis theory usually rejects the Münsterites and other radicals from the category of true Anabaptists.{{Sfn | Estep | 1963 | p = 5 | ps = : 'Too much has been said of Münster. It belongs on the fringe of Anabaptist life which was completely divorced from the evangelical, biblical heart of the movement'}} In the monogenesis view the time of origin is January 21, 1525, when Conrad Grebel baptized George Blaurock, and Blaurock in turn baptized several others immediately. These baptisms were the first &quot;re-baptisms&quot; known in the movement.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 49}} This continues to be the most widely accepted date posited for the establishment of Anabaptism.

==== Polygenesis ====
[[James M. Stayer]], [[Werner O. Packull]], and [[Klaus Deppermann]] disputed the idea of a single origin of Anabaptists in a 1975 essay entitled &quot;From Monogenesis to Polygenesis&quot;, suggesting that February 24, 1527, at Schleitheim is the proper date of the origin of Anabaptism. On this date the Swiss Brethren wrote a declaration of belief called the [[Schleitheim Confession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;monogenesis&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first1 = James M | last1 = Stayer | first2 = Werner O | last2 = Packull | first3 = Klaus | last3 = Deppermann | title = From Monogenesis to Polygenesis: the historical discussion of Anabaptist origins | journal = Mennonite Quarterly Review | volume = 49 | number = 2 |date=April 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The authors of the essay noted the agreement among previous Anabaptist historians on polygenesis, even when disputing the date for a single starting point: &quot;Hillerbrand and Bender (like Holl and Troeltsch) were in agreement that there was a single dispersion of Anabaptism ..., which certainly ran through Zurich. The only question was whether or not it went back further to Saxony.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;monogenesis&quot; /&gt;{{rp |83}} After criticizing the standard polygenetic history, the authors found six groups in early Anabaptism which could be collapsed into three originating &quot;points of departure&quot;: &quot;South German Anabaptism, the Swiss Brethren, and the Melchiorites&quot;.{{Sfn | Stayer | 1994 | p = 86}}  According to their polygenesis theory, South German–Austrian Anabaptism &quot;was a diluted form of [[Rhineland mysticism]]&quot;, Swiss Anabaptism &quot;arose out of Reformed [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalism]]&quot;, and Dutch Anabaptism was formed by &quot;Social unrest and the apocalyptic visions of [[Melchior Hoffman]]&quot;. As examples of how the Anabaptist movement was influenced from sources other than the Swiss Brethren movement, mention has been made of how Pilgram Marpeck's ''Vermanung'' of 1542 was deeply influenced by the ''Bekenntnisse'' of 1533 by Münster theologian [[Bernhard Rothmann]]. Melchior Hoffman influenced the Hutterites when they used his commentary on the Apocalypse shortly after he wrote it.

Others who have written in support of polygenesis include [[Grete Mecenseffy]] and Walter Klaassen, who established links between Thomas Müntzer and Hans Hut. In another work, Gottfried Seebaß and Werner Packull showed the influence of Thomas Müntzer on the formation of South German Anabaptism. Similarly, author Steven Ozment linked [[Hans Denck]] and [[Hans Hut]] with Thomas Müntzer, [[Sebastian Franck]], and others. Author Calvin Pater showed how [[Andreas Karlstadt]] influenced Swiss Anabaptism in various areas, including his view of Scripture, doctrine of the church, and views on baptism. 

Several historians, including Thor Hall,&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Thor. &quot;Possibilities of Erasmian Influence on Denck and Hubmaier in Their Views of Freedom of the Will.&quot; ''Mennonite Quarterly Review'' 35 (1961): 149-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Davis,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Kenneth R. &quot;Erasmus as a Progenitor of Anabaptist Theology and Piety.&quot; ''Mennonite Quarterly Review'' 47 (1973): 163-78.&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Kreider,&lt;ref&gt;Kreider, Robert. &quot;Anabaptism and Humanism: an Inquiry Into the Relationship of Humanism to the Evangelical Anabaptists.&quot; ''Mennonite Quarterly Review'' 26 (1952): 123-41.&lt;/ref&gt; have also noted the influence of [[Renaissance humanism|Humanism]] on Radical Reformers in the three originating points of departure to account for how this brand of reform could develop independently from each other. Relatively recent research, begun in a more advanced and deliberate manner by Andrew P. Klager, also explores how the influence and a particular reading of the [[Church Fathers]] contributed to the development of distinctly Anabaptist beliefs and practices in separate regions of Europe in the early 16th century, including by Menno Simons in the Netherlands, Conrad Grebel in Switzerland, Thomas Müntzer in central Germany, Pilgram Marpeck in the Tyrol, Peter Walpot in Moravia, and especially Balthasar Hubmaier in southern Germany, Switzerland, and Moravia.&lt;ref&gt;Klager, Andrew P.

==== Apostolic succession ====
[[Baptist successionism|Baptist successionists]] have, at times, pointed to 16th-century Anabaptists as part of an [[apostolic succession]] of churches (&quot;church perpetuity&quot;) from the time of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carrol|first=JM|title=The Trail of Blood|publisher=Ashland Avenue Baptist Church|location=Lexington, [[Kentucky|KY]]|year=1931|url=http://www.trailofblood.com/The%20Trail%20Of%20Blood.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221104428/http://www.trailofblood.com/The%20Trail%20Of%20Blood.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is held by some Baptists, some Mennonites, and a number of &quot;true church&quot; movements.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;A &quot;true church&quot; movement is a part of the Protestant or Reformed group of Christianity that claims to represent the true faith and order of New Testament Christianity. Most only assert this in relation to their church doctrines, polity, and practice (e.g., the ordinances), while a few hold they are the only true Christians. Some examples of ''Anabaptistic'' true church movements are the [[Landmark Baptist Church|Landmark Baptists]] and the [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]]. The [[Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee)|Church of God]], the Stone-Campbell [[restoration movement]], and others represent a variation in which the &quot;true church&quot; apostatized and was restored, in distinction to this idea of apostolic or church succession. These groups trace their &quot;true church&quot; status through means other than those generally accepted by Roman Catholicism or Orthodox Christianity, both of which likewise claim to represent the true faith and order of New Testament Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opponents of the Baptist successionism theory emphasize that these non-Catholic groups clearly differed from each other, that they held some heretical views,&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Such as the Adoptionism of the [[Paulicianists]]; some of the other groups often cited were in fact little different from the Catholics and bore little similarity to modern Baptists.&lt;/ref&gt; or that the groups had no connection with one another and had origins that were separate both in time and in place.

A different strain of successionism is the theory that the Anabaptists are of [[Waldensians|Waldensian]] origin. Some hold the idea that the Waldensians are part of the apostolic succession, while others simply believe they were an independent group out of whom the Anabaptists arose. Ludwig Keller, Thomas M. Lindsay, H. C. Vedder, Delbert Grätz, [[John T. Christian]] and [[Thieleman J. van Braght]] (author of [[Martyrs Mirror]]) all held, in varying degrees, the position that the Anabaptists were of Waldensian origin.

=== Switzerland ===
Anabaptism in Switzerland began as an offshoot of the church reforms instigated by [[Huldrych Zwingli|Ulrich Zwingli]].  As early as 1522 it became evident that Zwingli was on a path of reform preaching when he began to question or criticize such Catholic practices as tithes, the mass, and even infant baptism. Zwingli had gathered a group of reform-minded men around him, with whom he studied classical literature and the scriptures. However, some of these young men began to feel that Zwingli was not moving fast enough in his reform. The division between Zwingli and his more radical disciples became apparent in an October 1523 disputation held in Zurich. When the discussion of the mass was about to be ended without making any actual change in practice, Conrad Grebel stood up and asked &quot;what should be done about the mass?&quot; Zwingli responded by saying the council would make that decision. At this point, Simon Stumpf, a radical priest from [[Höngg]], answered saying, &quot;The decision has already been made by the Spirit of God.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruth&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Ruth | first=John L.|title=Conrad Grebel, Son of Zurich | publisher=Herald Press | location=Scottdale, PA | year=1975|page=79 |isbn = 0-8361-1767-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This incident illustrated clearly that Zwingli and his more radical disciples had different expectations. To Zwingli, the reforms would only go as fast as the city Council allowed them. To the radicals, the council had no right to make that decision, but rather the Bible was the final authority of church reform. Feeling frustrated, some of them began to meet on their own for Bible study.  As early as 1523, William Reublin began to preach against infant baptism in villages surrounding Zurich, encouraging parents to not baptize their children.

Seeking fellowship with other reform-minded people, the radical group wrote letters to [[Martin Luther]], Andreas Karlstadt, and Thomas Müntzer. Felix Manz began to publish some of Karlstadt's writings in Zurich in late 1524. By this time the question of infant baptism had become agitated and the Zurich council had instructed Zwingli to meet weekly with those who rejected infant baptism &quot;until the matter could be resolved&quot;.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 46}} Zwingli broke off the meetings after two sessions, and Felix Manz petitioned the Council to find a solution, since he felt Zwingli was too hard to work with. The council then called a meeting for January 17, 1525.

[[File:Täuferdisputation 1525.jpg|thumb|Dissatisfaction with the outcome of a disputation in 1525 prompted [[Swiss Brethren]] to part ways with [[Huldrych Zwingli]].]]
The Council ruled in this meeting that all who continued to refuse to baptize their infants should be expelled from Zurich if they did not have them baptized within one week. Since Conrad Grebel had refused to baptize his daughter Rachel, born on January 5, 1525, the Council decision was extremely personal to him and others who had not baptized their children. Thus, when sixteen of the radicals met on Saturday evening, January 21, 1525, the situation seemed particularly dark. The Hutterian Chronicle records the event:
{{quote |After prayer, George of the House of Jacob (George Blaurock) stood up and besought Conrad Grebel for God's sake to baptize him with the true Christian baptism upon his faith and knowledge. And when he knelt down with such a request and desire, Conrad baptized him, since at that time there was no ordained minister to perform such work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chronicle of the Hutterian Brethren, Known as Das grosse Geschichtbuch der Hutterischen Brüder|location=Rifton, New York|publisher=Plough Pub. House|date=1987|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Afterwards Blaurock was baptized, he in turn baptized others at the meeting. Even though some had rejected infant baptism before this date, these baptisms marked the first re-baptisms of those who had been baptized as infants and thus, technically, Swiss Anabaptism was born on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-28/1525-anabaptist-movement-begins.html|title=1525, The Anabaptist Movement Begins|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/anabaptist-beginnings|title=A Fire That Spread Anabaptist Beginnings|publisher=Christian History Institute|first=Walter|last=Klaassen|location=Waterloo, ON, Canada|date=1985|issue=no.5|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tyrol ===
Anabaptism appears to have come to [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] through the labors of George Blaurock. Similar to the German Peasants' War, the Gasmair uprising set the stage by producing a hope for social justice. [[Michael Gasmair]] had tried to bring religious, political, and economical reform through a violent peasant uprising, but the movement was squashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Hoover | first= Peter | title= The Mystery of the Mark-Anabaptist Mission Work under the Fire of God | location=Mountain Lake, Minnesota | publisher= Elmendorf Books | year=2008 | pages=14–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although little hard evidence exists of a direct connection between Gasmair's uprising and Tyrolian Anabaptism, at least a few of the peasants involved in the uprising later became Anabaptists. While a connection between a violent social revolution and non-resistant Anabaptism may be hard to imagine, the common link was the desire for a radical change in the prevailing social injustices. Disappointed with the failure of armed revolt, Anabaptist ideals of an alternative peaceful, just society probably resonated on the ears of the disappointed peasants.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | pp = 169–75}}

Before Anabaptism proper was introduced to South Tyrol, Protestant ideas had been propagated in the region by men such as Hans Vischer, a former Dominican.  Some of those who participated in conventicles where Protestant ideas were presented later became Anabaptists. As well, the population in general seemed to have a favorable attitude towards reform, be it Protestant or Anabaptist. George Blaurock appears to have preached itinerantly in the Puster Valley region in 1527, which most likely was the first introduction of Anabaptist ideas in the area. Another visit through the area in 1529 reinforced these ideas, but he was captured and burned at the stake in [[Klausen, South Tyrol|Klausen]] on September 6, 1529.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | pp = 181–5}}

[[Jacob Hutter]] was one of the early converts in South Tyrol, and later became a leader among the [[Hutterites]], who received their name from him. Hutter made several trips between Moravia and Tyrol, and most of the Anabaptists in South Tyrol ended up emigrating to Moravia because of the fierce persecution unleashed by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]].  In November 1535, Hutter was captured near Klausen and taken to Innsbruck where he was burned at the stake on February 25, 1536. By 1540 Anabaptism in South Tyrol was beginning to die out, largely because of the emigration to Moravia of the converts because of incessant persecution.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | p = 280}}

=== Low Countries and northern Germany ===
[[Image:Menno Simons.jpg|thumb|upright|Menno Simons]]
Melchior Hoffman is credited with the introduction of Anabaptist ideas into the Low Countries. Hoffman had picked up Lutheran and Reformed ideas, but on April 23, 1530 he was &quot;re-baptized&quot; at [[Strasbourg]] and within two months had gone to [[Emden]] and baptized about 300 persons.{{Sfn | Estep | 1963 | p = 109}}  For several years Hoffman preached in the Low Countries until he was arrested and imprisoned at Strasbourg, where he died about 10 years later. Hoffman's apocalyptic ideas were indirectly related to the [[Münster Rebellion]], even though he was &quot;of a different spirit&quot;.{{Sfn | Estep | 1963 | p = 111}} [[Obbe Philips|Obbe]] and [[Dirk Philips]] had been baptized by disciples of [[Jan Matthijs]], but were opposed to the violence that occurred at Münster.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 105}} Obbe later became disillusioned with Anabaptism and withdrew from the movement in about 1540, but not before ordaining [[David Joris]], his brother Dirk, and [[Menno Simons]], the latter from whom the [[Mennonite]]s received their name.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 111}} David Joris and Menno Simons parted ways, with Joris placing more emphasis on &quot;spirit and prophecy&quot;, while Menno emphasized the authority of the Bible. For the Mennonite side, the emphasis on the &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;spiritual&quot; permitted compromise to &quot;escape persecution&quot;, while to the Joris side, the Mennonites were under the &quot;dead letter of the Scripture&quot;.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 111}}

Because of persecution and expansion, some of the [[Low Countries|Low Country]] Mennonites emigrated to [[Vistula]] delta, a region settled by Germans but under Polish rule until it became part of [[Prussia]] in 1772. There they formed the [[Vistula delta Mennonites]] integrating some other Mennonites mainly from Northern Germany. In the late 18th century, several thousand of them migrated from there to Ukraine (which at the time was part of Russia) forming the so-called [[Russian Mennonite]]s. Beginning in 1874, many of them emigrated to the prairie states and provinces of the United States and Canada. In the 1920s, the conservative faction of the Canadian settlers went to Mexico and Paraguay. Beginning in the 1950s, the most conservative of them started to migrate to Bolivia. In 1958, Mexican Mennonites migrated to Belize. Since the 1980s, traditional Russian Mennonites migrated to Argentina. Smaller groups went to Brazil and Uruguay. In 2015, some Mennonites from Bolivia settled in Peru. In 2018, there are more than 200,000 of them living in colonies in Central and South America.

=== Moravia, Bohemia and Silesia ===
Although Moravian Anabaptism was a transplant from other areas of Europe, Moravia soon became a center for the growing movement, largely because of the greater religious tolerance found there.{{Sfn | Estep | 1963 | p = 89}}{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | p = 54}} Hans Hut was an early evangelist in the area, with one historian crediting him with baptizing more converts in two years than all the other Anabaptist evangelists put together.{{Sfn | Dyck | 1967 | p = 67}} The coming of [[Balthasar Hübmaier]] to [[Nikolsburg]] was a definite boost for Anabaptist ideas to the area. With the great influx of religious refugees from all over Europe, many variations of Anabaptism appeared in Moravia, with Jarold Zeman documenting at least ten slightly different versions.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | p = 55}} Soon, one-eyed Jacob Wiedemann appeared at Nikolsburg, and began to teach the pacifistic convictions of the Swiss Brethren, on which Hübmaier had been less authoritative. This would lead to a division between the ''Schwertler'' (sword-bearing) and the ''Stäbler'' (staff-bearing). Wiedemann and those with him also promoted the practice of [[community of goods]]. With orders from the lords of Liechtenstein to leave Nikolsburg, about 200 ''Stäbler'' withdrew to Moravia to form a community at Austerlitz.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995 | p = 61}}

Persecution in [[South Tyrol]] brought many refugees to Moravia, many of whom formed into communities that practised community of goods. Jacob Hutter was instrumental in organizing these into what became known as the Hutterites. But others came from [[Silesia]], Switzerland, German lands, and the Low Countries. With the passing of time and persecution, all the other versions of Anabaptism would die out in Moravia leaving only the Hutterites. Even the Hutterites would be dissipated by persecution, with a remnant fleeing to [[Transylvania]], then to the Ukraine, and finally to North America in 1874.{{Sfn | Packull | 1995}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=October 2012}}

=== South and central Germany, Austria and Alsace ===
[[File:Thomas Muentzer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Müntzer]] led the German peasants against the landowners]]
South German Anabaptism had its roots in [[German mysticism]]. Andreas Karlstadt, who first worked alongside Martin Luther, is seen as a forerunner of South German Anabaptism because of his reforming theology that rejected many Catholic practices, including infant baptism. However, Karlstadt is not known to have been &quot;rebaptized&quot;, nor to have taught it. Hans Denck and Hans Hut, both with German Mystical background (in connection with [[Thomas Müntzer]]) both accepted &quot;rebaptism&quot;, but Denck eventually backed off from the idea under pressure. Hans Hut is said to have brought more people into early Anabaptism than all the other Anabaptist evangelists of his time put together. However, there may have been confusion about what his baptism (at least some of the times it was done by making the sign of the [[Tau#Symbolism|Tau]] on the forehead) may have meant to the recipient. Some seem to have taken it as a sign by which they would escape the apocalyptical revenge of the Turks that Hut predicted. Hut even went so far as to predict a 1528 coming of the kingdom of God. When the prediction failed, some of his converts became discouraged and left the Anabaptist movement. The large congregation of Anabaptists at Augsburg fell apart (partly because of persecution) and those who stayed with Anabaptist ideas were absorbed into Swiss and Moravia Anabaptist congregations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Packull-mysticism&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Packull | first=Werner O | title=Mysticism and the Early South German-Austrian Anabaptist Movement 1525–1531 | location=Scottdale, PA | publisher=Herald Press | year=1977 | isbn=0-8361-1130-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |35–117}}{{Sfn | Stayer | 1994}}  [[Pilgram Marpeck]] was another notable leader in early South German Anabaptism who attempted to steer between the two extremes of Denck's inner Holiness and the legalistic standards of the other Anabaptists.&lt;ref name=&quot;fireandwater&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loewen|first1=Harry|last2=Nolt|first2=Steven|title=Through Fire &amp; Water|date=1996|publisher=Herald Press|location=Scottdale, PA|pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholics and Protestants alike persecuted the Anabaptists, resorting to torture and execution in attempts to curb the growth of the movement. The Protestants under Zwingli were the first to persecute the Anabaptists, with Felix Manz becoming the first martyr in 1527. On May 20 or 21, 1527, Roman Catholic authorities executed [[Michael Sattler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Bossert, Jr. |first1=Gustav |first2=Harold S. |last2=Bender |first3=C.

The Tudor regime, even the Protestant monarchs ([[Edward VI of England]] and [[Elizabeth I of England]]), persecuted Anabaptists as they were deemed too radical and therefore a danger to religious stability.

[[File:Witch-scene4.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The burning of a 16th-century Dutch Anabaptist, Anneken Hendriks, who was charged with heresy.]]
The persecution of Anabaptists was condoned by ancient laws of [[Theodosius I]] and [[Justinian I]] that were passed against the [[Donatists]], which decreed the death penalty for any who practised rebaptism. ''Martyrs Mirror'', by Thieleman J. van Braght, describes the persecution and execution of thousands of Anabaptists in various parts of Europe between 1525 and 1660. Continuing persecution in Europe was largely responsible for the mass emigrations to North America by [[Amish]], Hutterites, and [[Mennonites]]. Unlike [[Calvinists]], Anabaptists failed to get recognition in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 and persecution continued in Europe well after that treaty.

== Types ==
{{Main|Theology of Anabaptism}}
Different types exist among the Anabaptists, although the categorizations tend to vary with the scholar's viewpoint on origins. Estep claims that in order to understand Anabaptism, one must &quot;distinguish between the Anabaptists, inspirationists, and rationalists&quot;. He classes the likes of Blaurock, Grebel, [[Balthasar Hubmaier]], Manz, Marpeck, and Simons as Anabaptists. He groups Müntzer, Storch, et al. as inspirationists, and anti-trinitarians such as [[Michael Servetus]], [[Juan de Valdes|Juan de Valdés]], [[Sebastian Castellio]], and [[Faustus Socinus]] as [[rationalism|rationalists]]. Mark S. Ritchie follows this line of thought, saying, &quot;The Anabaptists were one of several branches of 'Radical' reformers (i.e. reformers that went further than the mainstream Reformers) to arise out of the Renaissance and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Two other branches were Spirituals or Inspirationists, who believed that they had received direct revelation from the Spirit, and rationalists or anti-Trinitarians, who rebelled against traditional Christian doctrine, like Michael Servetus.&quot;

Those of the polygenesis viewpoint use ''Anabaptist'' to define the larger movement, and include the inspirationists and rationalists as true Anabaptists. James M. Stayer used the term ''Anabaptist'' for those who ''rebaptized'' persons already &quot;baptized&quot; in infancy. Walter Klaassen was perhaps the first Mennonite scholar to define ''Anabaptists'' that way in his 1960 Oxford dissertation. This represents a rejection of the previous standard held by Mennonite scholars such as Bender and Friedmann.

Another method of categorization acknowledges regional variations, such as Swiss Brethren (Grebel, Manz), Dutch and [[Frisia]]n Anabaptism (Menno Simons, [[Dirk Philips]]), and South German Anabaptism (Hübmaier, Marpeck).

Historians and sociologists have made further distinctions between radical Anabaptists, who were prepared to use violence in their attempts to build a [[New Jerusalem]], and their pacifist brethren, later broadly known as Mennonites. Radical Anabaptist groups included the Münsterites, who occupied and held the German city of [[Münster]] in 1534–1535, and the [[Batenburgers]], who persisted in various guises as late as the 1570s.

[[File:Zürich - Schipfe IMG 1969.JPG|thumb|Memorial plate at [[Schipfe]] quarter in [[Zürich]] for the Anabaptists executed in the early 16th century by the Zürich city government]]

=== Charismatic manifestations ===
Within the inspirationist wing of the Anabaptist movement, it was not unusual for [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] manifestations to appear, such as dancing, falling under the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], &quot;prophetic processions&quot; (at Zurich in 1525, at Munster in 1534 and at Amsterdam in 1535),{{Sfn | Klaassen | 1973 | p = 63}} and speaking in tongues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Franklin H | last = Little | title = The Origins of Sectarian Protestantism | place = New York | publisher = Beacons | year = 1964 | page = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany some Anabaptists, &quot;excited by mass hypnosis, experienced healings, glossolalia, contortions and other manifestations of a camp-meeting revival&quot;.{{Sfn | Williams | 2000 | p = 667}}  The Anabaptist congregations that later developed into the Mennonite and Hutterite churches tended not to promote these manifestations, but did not totally reject the miraculous. Pilgram Marpeck, for example, wrote against the exclusion of miracles: &quot;Nor does Scripture assert this exclusion ...  God has a free hand even in these last days.&quot; Referring to some who had been raised from the dead, he wrote: &quot;Many of them have remained constant, enduring tortures inflicted by sword, rope, fire and water and suffering terrible, tyrannical, unheard-of deaths and martyrdoms, all of which they could easily have avoided by recantation.  Moreover one also marvels when he sees how the faithful God (Who, after all, overflows with goodness) raises from the dead several such brothers and sisters of Christ after they were hanged, drowned, or killed in other ways. Even today, they are found alive and we can hear their own testimony ...  Cannot everyone who sees, even the blind, say with a good conscience that such things are a powerful, unusual, and miraculous act of God? Those who would deny it must be hardened men.&quot;{{Sfn | Marpeck | 1978 | p = 50}}  The [[Hutterite]] Chronicle and the ''Martyrs Mirror'' record several accounts of miraculous events, such as when a man named Martin prophesied while being led across a bridge to his execution in 1531: &quot;this once yet the pious are led over this bridge, but no more hereafter&quot;. Just &quot;a short time afterwards such a violent storm and flood came that the bridge was demolished&quot;.{{Sfn | van Braght | 1950 | p = 440}}

=== Holy Spirit leadership ===
The Anabaptists insisted upon the &quot;free course&quot; of the Holy Spirit in worship, yet still maintained it all must be judged according to the Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John S | last = Oyer | title = Lutheran Reformers Against Anabaptists | place = The Hague | publisher = M Nijhoff | year = 1964 | page = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss Anabaptist document titled &quot;Answer of Some Who Are Called (Ana-)Baptists&amp;nbsp;– Why They Do Not Attend the Churches&quot;. One reason given for not attending the state churches was that these institutions forbade the congregation to exercise spiritual gifts according to &quot;the Christian order as taught in the gospel or the Word of God in 1 Corinthians 14&quot;. &quot;When such believers come together, 'Everyone of you (note every one) hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation', and so on. When someone comes to church and constantly hears only one person speaking, and all the listeners are silent, neither speaking nor prophesying, who can or will regard or confess the same to be a spiritual congregation, or confess according to 1 Corinthians 14 that God is dwelling and operating in them through His Holy Spirit with His gifts, impelling them one after another in the above-mentioned order of speaking and prophesying.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-first = Paul | editor1-last = Peachey | editor2-first = Shem | editor2-last = Peachey | title = Answer of Some Who Are Called (Ana-)Baptists&amp;nbsp;– Why They Do Not Attend the Churches | journal = Mennonite Quarterly Review | volume = 45 | number = 1 | year = 1971 | pages = 10, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several existing denominational bodies are the direct successors of the continental Anabaptists. Mennonites, Amish and Hutterites are in a direct and unbroken line back to the Anabapists of the early 16th century. [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] and [[River Brethren]] emerged in the 18th century and adopted many Anabapist elements. The same is true for the [[Bruderhof Communities]] that emerged in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the [[Apostolic Christian Church]] is seen as ''Neutäufer'' (&quot;Neo-Anabaptist&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Apostolic_Christian_Church_of_America|title=Apostolic Christian Church of America|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historical connections have been demonstrated for all of these spiritual descendants, though perhaps not as clearly as the noted institutionally lineal descendants.

Although many see the more well-known Anabaptist groups (Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites) as ethnic groups, only the Amish and the Hutterites today are composed almost totally of descendants of the continental Anabaptists, while among the Mennonites there are [[Ethnic Mennonite]]s and others who are not. Brethren groups have mostly lost their ethnic distinctiveness.

Total worldwide membership of the Mennonite, [[Brethren in Christ]] and related churches totals 1,616,126 (as of 2009) with about 60 percent in Africa, Asia and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://mbherald.com/new-global-map-locates-1-6-million-anabaptists/ | title = New global map locates 1.6&amp;nbsp;million Anabaptists | publisher = Mennonite Brethren Herald | author = [[Mennonite World Conference]] | date = December 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 there were some 300,000 Amish, more than 200,000 [[Russian Mennonites|&quot;Russian&quot; Mennonites]] in Latin America, some 60,000 to 80,000 [[Old Order Mennonites]] and some 50,000 Hutterites, who have preserved their ethnicity, their German dialects ([[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]], [[Plautdietsch]], [[Hutterisch]]), [[plain dress]] and other old traditions.

The group moved to England after the [[Nazi Dissolution of the Bruderhof|Gestapo confiscated their property]] in 1933, and subsequently to Paraguay to avoid military conscription, and by settlement then moved the United States after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/354366939/Church-Community-is-a-Gift-of-the-Holy-Spirit-The-Spirituality-of-the-Bruderhof|title=Church Community is a Gift of the Holy Spirit – The Spirituality of the Bruderhof {{!}} Anabaptism {{!}} Religion &amp; Spirituality|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups deriving from the Schwarzenau Brethren, often called German Baptists, while not directly descended from the 16th-century Anabaptists, are usually considered Anabaptist because of an almost identical doctrine and practice. The modern-day Brethren movement is a combination of Anabaptism and [[Radical Pietism]].

The relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were early strained.  In 1624, the then five existing Baptist churches of London issued a condemnation of the Anabaptists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Melton|first=JG|contribution=Baptists|title=Encyclopedia of American Religions|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Puritan]]s of England and their [[Baptist]] branch arose independently, and although they may have been informed by Anabaptist theology, they clearly differentiate themselves from Anabaptists as seen in the London Baptist Confession of Faith A.D. 1644, &quot;Of those Churches which are commonly (though falsely) called ANABAPTISTS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bc1644.htm |title=London Baptist Confession of 1644 |quote=Of those Churches which are commonly (though falsely) called ANABAPTISTS; |work=spurgeon.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617103253/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bc1644.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Baptist historian Chris Traffanstedt maintains that Anabaptists share &quot;some similarities with the early General Baptists, but overall these similarities are slight and not always relational. In the end, we must come to say that this group of Christians does not reflect the historical teaching of the Baptists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Traffanstedt|first=Chris|contribution=Baptists|title=A Primer on Baptist History: The True Baptist Trail|year=1994|url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/history/trail.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911033859/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/history/trail.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; German Baptists are not related to the English Baptist movement and were inspired by central European Anabaptists. Upon moving to the United States, they associated with Mennonites and Quakers.

Anabaptist characters exist in popular culture, most notably [[Chaplain Tappman]] in [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel ''[[Catch-22]]'', James (Jacques) in [[Voltaire]]'s novella ''[[Candide]]'', [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s opera ''[[Le prophète (opera)|Le prophète]]'' (1849), and the central character in the novel ''[[Q (novel)|Q]]'', by the collective known as &quot;Luther Blissett&quot;.

=== Neo-Anabaptists ===
The term ''Neo-Anabaptist'' has been used to describe a late twentieth and early twenty-first century theological movement within American [[evangelical Christianity]] which draws inspiration from theologians located within the Anabaptist tradition while remaining ecclesiastically outside of it. Neo-Anabaptists have been noted for its &quot;low church, counter-cultural, prophetic-stance-against-empire ethos&quot; and for focusing on [[pacifism]], [[social justice]] and [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DeYoung&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeYoung|first1=Kevin|title=The Neo-Anabaptists|url=https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/kevindeyoung/2009/06/03/neo-anabaptists/|website=The Gospel Coalition|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hiebert |first1=Jared |last2=Hiebert |first2=Terry G. |title=New Calvinists and Neo-Anabaptists: A Tale of Two Tribes |journal=Direction: A Mennonite Brethren Forum |date=Fall 2013 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=178–194 |url=http://www.directionjournal.org/42/2/new-calvinists-and-neo-anabaptists-tale.html |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of Mennonite theologians [[Ron Sider]] and [[John Howard Yoder]] are frequently cited as having a strong influence on the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tooley |first1=Mark |title=Mennonite Takeover? |url=https://spectator.org/38818_mennonite-takeover/ |website=The American Spectator |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anabaptists were early promoters of a free church and freedom of religion (sometimes associated with separation of church and state).{{Refn | group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; | The origins of religious freedom in the United States are traced back to the Anabaptists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Verduin | first = Leonard | title = That First Amendment and The Remnant | publisher = [[The Christian Hymnary]] | year = 1998 | ISBN = 1-890050-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  When it was introduced by the Anabaptists in the 15th and 16th centuries, religious freedom independent of the state was unthinkable to both clerical and governmental leaders.

'''Southeast Alaska''' ({{lang-ru|Юго-Восточная Аляска}}), colloquially referred to as the '''Alaska Panhandle''' or '''Alaskan Panhandle''', is the southeastern portion of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]], bordered to the east by the northern half of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]]. The majority of Southeast Alaska's area is part of the [[Tongass National Forest]], the United States' largest [[United States National Forest|national forest]]. In many places, the [[international border]] runs along the crest of the [[Boundary Ranges]] of the [[Coast Mountains]] (see [[Alaska boundary dispute]]). The region is noted for its scenery and mild, rainy [[climate]].

The largest cities in the region are [[Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and [[Ketchikan]]. This region is also home to the easternmost town in Alaska, [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]].

==Geography==
Southeast Alaska has a land area of {{convert|35138|sqmi|sqkm}}{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}, comprising much of the [[Alexander Archipelago]]. The largest islands are, from North to South, [[Chichagof Island]], [[Admiralty Island]], [[Baranof Island]], [[Kupreanof Island]], [[Revillagigedo Island]] and [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]. Major bodies of water of Southeast Alaska include [[Glacier Bay]], [[Lynn Canal]], [[Icy Strait]], [[Chatham Strait]], [[Stephens Passage]], [[Frederick Sound]], [[Sumner Strait]], and [[Clarence Strait]]. 

The archipelago is the northern terminus of the [[Inside Passage]], a protected waterway of convoluted passages between islands and fjords, beginning in [[Puget Sound]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. This was an important travel corridor for [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tsimshian]] Native peoples, as well as gold-rush era steamships. In modern times it is an important route for [[Alaska Marine Highway]] ferries as well as [[cruise ship]]s.

==Demographics==
[[File:Downtown Juneau and Douglas Island.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Juneau, Alaska|The City and Borough of Juneau]], the most populous borough in Southeast Alaska.]]
[[File:Downtown Ketchikan - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska|Ketchikan Gateway Borough]], the second most populous borough in Southeast Alaska.]]
Southeast Alaska is composed of seven entire [[county-equivalent|borough]]s and two [[census area]]s, in addition to the portion of the [[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat Borough]] lying east of [[141st meridian west|141° West]] longitude. Although it has only 6.14 percent of Alaska's land area, it is larger than the state of [[Maine]], and almost as large as the state of [[Indiana]]. The Southeast Alaskan coast is roughly as long as the [[British Columbia Coast|west coast]] of Canada.

The [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] population of Southeast Alaska was 71,616 inhabitants, about 45 percent of whom were concentrated in the city of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. As of 2018, the number of settlements in Southeast Alaska that have a population of at least 1,000 people has grown to nine.

==National parks and monuments==
[[Image:TongassForest1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Tongass National Forest]], near [[Ketchikan]]]]
Southeast Alaska includes the [[Tongass National Forest]] (which manages [[Admiralty Island National Monument]] and [[Misty Fjords National Monument]]), [[Glacier Bay National Park]], [[Sitka National Historical Park]], [[Alaska's Inside Passage]], and myriad large and small islands. It is the largest [[national park]] in the [[United States]]. On August 20, 1902, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the [[Alexander Archipelago Forest Reserve]], which formed the heart of the [[Tongass National Forest]] that covers most of the region.

*[[Sitka National Historical Park]]
*[[Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve]] (part, the most southeastern section only)
*[[Admiralty Island National Monument]]
*[[Misty Fjords National Monument]]

==Climate==
[[File:Southeast Alaska Köppen.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in southeast Alaska]]
The climate of Southeast Alaska is dominated by a mid-latitude [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'') in the south, an oceanic, marine sub-polar climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfc'') in the central region around [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], and a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfc'') to the far northwest and the interior highlands of the archipelago. Southeast Alaska is also the only region in Alaska where the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.

==Ecology==
Southeast Alaska is a [[temperate rain forest]] within the [[Pacific temperate rain forest]] zone, as classified by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[ecoregion]] system, which extends from northern [[California]] to [[Prince William Sound]]. The most common tree species are [[sitka spruce]] and [[western hemlock]].

Wildlife includes [[brown bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s, endemic [[Alexander Archipelago wolf]] packs, [[black-tailed deer|Sitka black-tailed deer]], [[humpback whale]]s, [[orca]]s, five species of [[salmon]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[harlequin duck]]s, [[scoter]]s, and [[marbled murrelet]]s.

The [https://indd.adobe.com/view/bb243dff-5852-44c5-bdf5-4b1be96bdc53 Ecological Atlas of Southeast Alaska], published by Audubon Alaska in 2016, offers an overview of the region's landscape, birds, wildlife, human uses, climate change, and more, synthesizing data from agencies and a variety of other sources.

==Culture==
[[File:Raventotemsitka.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Totem pole at [[Sitka National Historical Park]]]]
This area is the traditional homeland of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], and home of a historic settling of [[Haida people|Haida]] as well as a modern settlement of [[Tsimshian]]. The region is closely connected to [[Seattle]] and the American [[Pacific Northwest]] economically and culturally.

==Industry==
Major industries in Southeast Alaska include [[commercial fishing]] and [[tourism]] (primarily the cruise ship industry). 

=== Logging ===
[[Logging]] has been an important industry in the past, but has been steadily declining with competition from other areas and the closure of the region's major pulp mills; the Alaska Forest Association described the situation as &quot;desperate&quot; in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alaskajournal.com/business-and-finance/2011-11-03/ak-forest-association-se-timber-situation-desperate|title=AK Forest Association: SE timber situation 'desperate'|website=The Alaska Journal of Commerce|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419053843/http://www.alaskajournal.com/business-and-finance/2011-11-03/ak-forest-association-se-timber-situation-desperate|archivedate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members include Alcan Forest Products (owned by Canadian Transpac Group, one of the top 5 log exporters in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grouptranspac.com/about/history/|title=Our History - Trans-Pacific Energy Group|website=Trans-Pacific Energy Group|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317070844/http://grouptranspac.com/about/history/|archivedate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Viking Lumber, which is based in [[Craig, Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timberassociation.com/listing/viking-lumber-company-inc/|title=Viking Lumber Company, Inc.|website=TPM|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates over whether to expand logging in the federally owned Tongass are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sitnews.us/0311News/030311/030311_forests.html|title=SitNews: Murkowski Questions Forest Service Spending, Timber Sales;|last=SitNews|website=www.sitnews.us|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106151315/http://www.sitnews.us/0311News/030311/030311_forests.html|archivedate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/us/a-battle-to-keep-trees-or-an-industry-standing.html?_r=0|title=In Alaska, a Battle to Keep Trees, or an Industry, Standing - NYTimes.com|website=mobile.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106151100/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/us/a-battle-to-keep-trees-or-an-industry-standing.html?_r=0|archivedate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining ===
Mining remains important in the northern area with the [[Juneau mining district]] and [[Admiralty mining district]] hosting active mines as of 2015. Gold was discovered in 1880 and played an important part in the early history of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/alaska/seak/era/cfm/Documents/9.6_TimberIndustry.pdf|title=The Southeastern Alaska Timber Industry: Historical Overview and Current Status|last=Sisk|first=John|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106151630/http://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/alaska/seak/era/cfm/Documents/9.6_TimberIndustry.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, mines increasingly begun to be explored and eventually completed in neighboring [[British Columbia]], upstream of important rivers such as the [[Unuk River|Unuk]] and the [[Stikine River|Stikine]], which became known as the transboundary mining issue. In 2014, the [[Mount Polley mine disaster|Mount Polley Mine disaster]] focused attention on the issue, and an agreement between Canada and Alaska was drafted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alaskapublic.org/2015/11/18/alaska-drafts-transboundary-agreement-with-b-c/|title=Alaska drafts transboundary mine agreement with BC|last=Schoenfeld|first=Ed|last2=Juneau|first2=CoastAlaska-|website=Alaska Public Media|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119143417/http://www.alaskapublic.org/2015/11/18/alaska-drafts-transboundary-agreement-with-b-c/|archivedate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed [[Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell]] exploration is upstream of the Unuk. Mines upstream of the Stikine include the Red Chris, which is owned by the same company (Imperial Metals) as the Mount Polley mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/red-chris-mine-gets-green-light-from-b-c-government-1.3121297|title=B.C. government approves permits for controversial Red Chris Mine|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222192608/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/red-chris-mine-gets-green-light-from-b-c-government-1.3121297|archivedate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The border between Alaska and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] was the subject of the [[Alaska boundary dispute]], where the United States and the [[United Kingdom]] claimed different borderlines at the Alaskan panhandle. While the British foreign affairs were in favor of support of the Canadian argument, the event resulted in what was thought of as a betrayal, leading to alienation of the British from the new nation of [[Canada]].

==Transportation==
[[Image:Alaska Panhandle.png|thumb|250px|Southeast Alaska and [[Alaska Marine Highway]] ferry routes]]
Due to the extremely rugged, mountainous nature of Southeastern Alaska, almost all communities (with the exception of [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]], [[Skagway]], and [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]) have no road connections outside of their locale, so aircraft and boats are the major means of transport. The [[Alaska Marine Highway]] passes through this region.

===Air transportation===
[[Alaska Airlines]] is by far the largest air carrier in the region, with Juneau's [[Juneau International Airport]] serving as the aerial hub for all of Southeast and Ketchikan's [[Ketchikan International Airport]] serving as a secondary hub for southern Southeast Alaska. Alaska's [[Bush aviation|bush airlines ]] and [[air taxi]]s serve many of the smaller and more isolated communities and villages in the regions. Many communities are accessible by air only by [[floatplane]], as proper runways are often difficult to construct on the steep island slopes.

===Marine transportation===
Southeast Alaska is primarily served by the state-run [[Alaska Marine Highway]], which links Skagway, Haines, [[Hoonah, Alaska|Hoonah]], [[Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]], [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] and other outlying communities with [[Prince Rupert, BC]] and [[Bellingham, Washington]]; and secondarily by the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]-based [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]], which provides the only scheduled passenger and auto ferry service to the island. A new Authority, the Rainforest Islands Ferry Authority, was created and in 2014 may possibly operate the North End route. The Authority would connect Coffman Cove with Wrangell and Petersburg. Small companies like Sitka-based Allen Marine and other independent operators in the [[Lynn Canal]] occasionally also offer marine passenger service. Ship traffic in the area is seasonally busy with [[cruise ship]]s.

[[File:Interior fall.jpg|thumb|Fall in Interior Alaska.]]
'''Interior Alaska''' is the central region of [[Alaska]]'s territory, roughly bounded by the [[Alaska Range]] to the south and the [[Brooks Range]] to the north. It is largely [[wilderness]]. Mountains include [[Denali]] in the [[Alaska Range]], the [[Wrangell Mountains]], and the [[Ray Mountains]]. The [[Alaska Natives|native people]] of the interior are [[Alaskan Athabaskans]]. The largest city in the interior is [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]]'s second-largest city, in the [[Tanana Valley]]. Other towns include [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]], just southeast of Fairbanks, [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]], [[Tok, Alaska|Tok]], [[Glennallen, Alaska|Glennallen]], [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]], [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], [[Anderson, Alaska|Anderson]], [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] and [[Cantwell, Alaska|Cantwell]]. The interior region has an estimated population of 113,154.

== Climate ==
[[File:Big Dipper and Aurora.jpg|thumb|Northern Lights and Big Dipper at Fairbanks, AK during September.]]

Interior Alaska experiences extreme seasonal temperature variability. Winter temperatures in Fairbanks average −12&amp;nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (−24&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]]) and summer temperatures average +62&amp;nbsp;°F (+17&amp;nbsp;°C). Temperatures there have been recorded as low as −65&amp;nbsp;°F (−54&amp;nbsp;°C) in mid-winter, and as high as +99&amp;nbsp;°F (+37&amp;nbsp;°C) in summer. Both the highest and lowest temperature records for the state were set in the Interior, with 100&amp;nbsp;°F (38&amp;nbsp;°C) in [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] and −80&amp;nbsp;°F (−64&amp;nbsp;°C) in [[Prospect Creek, Alaska|Prospect Creek]].&lt;ref name=DRI&gt;{{cite web | title = State Extremes | publisher = Western Regional Climate Center, [[Desert Research Institute]] | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html | accessdate = 2007-01-03 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070105015744/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html| archivedate= 5 January 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures within a given winter are highly variable as well; extended cold snaps of forty below zero can be followed by unseasonable warmth with temperatures above freezing due to [[chinook wind]] effects.

Summers can be warm and dry for extended periods creating ideal fire weather conditions. Weak thunderstorms produce mostly dry lightning, sparking wildfires that are mostly left to burn themselves out as they are often far from populated areas. The [[2004 Alaska fire season|2004 season]] set a new record with over {{convert|6600000|acre|km2}} burned.
[[File:Lakesalaskarange.JPG|thumb|left|Lakes and peaks of the Alaska Range seen from the [[Denali Highway]]]]
The average annual precipitation in Fairbanks is 11.3&amp;nbsp;inches (28.7&amp;nbsp;cm).  Most of this comes in the form of snow during the winter.  Most storms in the interior of Alaska originate in the [[Gulf of Alaska]], south of the state, though these storms often have limited precipitation due to a [[rain shadow]] effect caused by the [[Alaska Range]].

On clear winter nights, the [[aurora borealis]] can often be seen dancing in the sky.  Like all subarctic regions, the months from May to July in the summer have no night, only a twilight during the night hours. The months of November to January have little daylight.  Fairbanks receives an average 21 hours of daylight between May 10 and August 2 each summer, and an average of less than four hours of daylight between November 18 and January 24 each winter.

The interior of Alaska is largely underlined by discontinuous [[permafrost]], which grades to continuous permafrost as the [[Arctic Circle]] is approached.

&quot;'''And did those feet in ancient time'''&quot; is a poem by [[William Blake]] from the preface to his epic ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'', one of a collection of writings known as the [[Blake's prophetic books|Prophetic Books]]. The date of 1804 on the title page is probably when the plates were begun, but the poem was printed c. 1808.&lt;ref name=cocel&gt;Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', &quot;1808&quot;, p 289, Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-860634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is best known as the hymn &quot;'''Jerusalem'''&quot;, with music written by [[Hubert Parry|Sir Hubert Parry]] in 1916. It is not to be confused with another poem, much longer and larger in scope, but also by Blake, called ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.

The poem was inspired by the [[apocryphal]] story that a young Jesus, accompanied by [[Joseph of Arimathea]], a tin merchant, travelled to what is now England and visited [[Glastonbury]] during his [[unknown years of Jesus|unknown years]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Icons1&quot;&gt;Icons – a portrait of England. Icon: Jerusalem (hymn) [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/features/and-did-those-feet Feature: And did those feet?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212021243/http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/features/and-did-those-feet |date=12 December 2009 }} Accessed 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stanford, &quot;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1231308/Did-Jesus-REALLY-stay-England-A-new-film-claims-built-church-Somerset-learnt-maths-Druids.html Did Jesus REALLY stay in England? A new film claims he built a church in Somerset and learnt maths from the Druids]&quot;, ''Daily Mail'', 27 November 2009. Retrieved 2016.10.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's theme is linked to the [[Book of Revelation]] ([[Revelation 3:12|3:12]] and [[Revelation 21|21]]:2) describing a [[Second Coming]], wherein Jesus establishes a [[New Jerusalem]]. Churches in general, and the [[Church of England]] in particular, have long used Jerusalem as a metaphor for [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], a place of universal love and peace.{{efn|The hymn 'Jerusalem the Golden with milk and honey blessed... I know not oh I know not what joys await me there....' uses Jerusalem for the same metaphor.}}

In the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake implies that a visit by Jesus would briefly create heaven in England, in contrast to the &quot;dark Satanic Mills&quot; of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Blake's poem asks four questions rather than asserting the historical truth of Christ's visit. Thus the poem merely implies that there may have been a divine visit, when there was briefly heaven in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/onepassions/2008/10/whats-your-anthem.html |title= The One Show |publisher=BBC |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/bring-no-spears-to-jerusalem-1347934.html John Walsh ''[[The Independent]]'' 18 May 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Dark Satanic Mills&quot;===
[[File:Albion Flour Mills Bankside.jpg|thumb|Albion Flour Mills, [[Bankside]], London]]
The phrase &quot;dark Satanic Mills&quot;, which entered the English language from this poem, is often interpreted as referring to the early [[Industrial Revolution]] and its destruction of nature and human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, John H. 1999 [http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1413.htm Poets in the Industrial Revolution.] [[The Engines of Our Ingenuity]] No. 1413: (Revised transcription)&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been linked to the fate of the [[Albion Mills, Southwark|Albion Flour Mills]] in [[Southwark]], the first major factory in London. This rotary steam-powered flour mill by [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]] could produce 6,000 [[bushel]]s of flour per week. The factory could have driven independent traditional millers out of business, but it was destroyed in 1791 by fire, perhaps [[Luddite|deliberately]]. London's independent millers celebrated with placards reading, &quot;Success to the mills of [[Albion]] but no Albion Mills.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICONS1&quot;&gt;ICONS – a portrait of England. Icon: Jerusalem (hymn) [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/features/and-did-those-feet Feature: And did those feet?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212021243/http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/features/and-did-those-feet |date=12 December 2009 }} Accessed 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents referred to the factory as [[satan]]ic, and accused its owners of adulterating flour and using cheap imports at the expense of British producers. A contemporary illustration of the fire shows a [[devil]] squatting on the building.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Maidment, ''Reading Popular Prints, 1790–1870'', Manchester University Press, 2001, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; The mills were a short distance from Blake's home.

Blake's phrase resonates with a broader theme in his works, what he envisioned as a physically and spiritually [[Political repression|repressive]] ideology based on a quantified reality. Blake saw the [[cotton mill]]s and [[collieries]] of the period as a mechanism for the enslavement of millions, but the concepts underpinning the works had a wider application:&lt;ref name=&quot;PortKaz&quot;&gt;[[Alfred Kazin]]: ''Introduction to a volume of Blake.'' 1946&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HallGen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.21learn.org/archive/articles/hall_genius.php |title=In Defense of Genius |last=Hall |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Hall (businessman) |date=8 February 1996 |work=Annual Lecture to the Arts Council of England |publisher=21st Century Learning Initiative |accessdate=19 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025003242/http://www.21learn.org/archive/articles/hall_genius.php |archivedate=25 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milton a Poem, copy C, object 4 (Bentley 4, Erdman 6, Keynes 4) detail-a.jpg|thumb|400px|The first reference to Satan's &quot;mills&quot;, next to images of megaliths ([[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]], copy C, object 4)]] Another interpretation, amongst [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s, is that the phrase refers to the established [[Church of England]]. This church preached a doctrine of conformity to the established social order and class system, in contrast to Blake. In 2007 the new [[Bishop of Durham]], [[N. T. Wright]], explicitly recognised this element of English subculture when he acknowledged this alternative view that the &quot;dark satanic mills&quot; refer to the &quot;great churches&quot;.&lt;ref name=DurhBish&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], Bishop of Durham (23 June 2007) &quot;[http://www.ntwrightpage.com/sermons/Durham_Wisdom.htm Where Shall Wisdom be Found?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022005251/http://ntwrightpage.com/sermons/Durham_Wisdom.htm |date=22 October 2013 }}&quot; Homily at the 175th anniversary of the founding of the [[University of Durham]]. ntwrightpage.com&lt;/ref&gt; In similar vein, the critic [[F. W. Bateson]] noted how &quot;the adoption by the Churches and women's organizations of this anti-clerical paean of free love is amusing evidence of the carelessness with which poetry is read&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Yvor Winters]], ''Forms of Discovery'' (1967) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stonehenge]] and other megaliths are featured in ''Milton'', suggesting they may relate to the oppressive power of priestcraft in general; as [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]] observed, many scholars argue that the &quot;[mills] are churches and not the factories of the Industrial Revolution everyone else takes them for&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Porter, ''The English Poets: from Chaucer to Edward Thomas'', Secker and Warburg, 1974, p.198., quoted in Shivashankar Mishra, ''The Rise of William Blake'', Mittal Publications, 1995, p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:Satanic mills.jpg|thumb|300px|The first reference to Satan's &quot;mills&quot;, next to images of megaliths]]--&gt;
An alternative theory is that Blake is referring to a mystical concept within his own mythology related to the ancient history of England. Satan's &quot;mills&quot; are referred to repeatedly in the main poem, and are first described in words which suggest neither industrialism nor ancient megaliths, but rather something more abstract: &quot;the starry Mills of Satan/ Are built beneath the earth and waters of the Mundane Shell...To Mortals thy Mills seem everything, and the Harrow of [[El Shaddai|Shaddai]] / A scheme of human conduct invisible and incomprehensible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, William, ''Milton: A Poem'', plate 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Chariot of fire&quot;===
The line from the poem &quot;Bring me my Chariot of fire!&quot; draws on the story of [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2 Kings 2:11]], where the [[Old Testament]] prophet [[Elijah]] is taken directly to heaven: &quot;And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.&quot; The phrase has become a byword for divine energy, and inspired the title of the 1981 film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', in which the hymn Jerusalem is sung during the final scenes. The plural phrase &quot;chariots of fire&quot; refers to 2 Kings 6:17.

===&quot;Green and pleasant Land&quot;===
Blake lived in London for most of his life, but wrote much of ''Milton'' while living in the village of [[Felpham]] in Sussex. Amanda Gilroy argues that the poem is informed by Blake's &quot;evident pleasure&quot; in the Felpham countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Amanda | last=Gilroy | title=Green and Pleasant Land: English Culture and the Romantic Countryside | publisher=Peeters Publishers | year=2004 | page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase &quot;green and pleasant land&quot; has become a common term for an identifiably English landscape or society. It appears as a headline, title or sub-title in numerous articles and books. Sometimes it refers, whether with appreciation, nostalgia or critical analysis, to idyllic or enigmatic aspects of the English countryside.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/eric-ravilious-green-and-pleasant-land-2025022.html &quot;Eric Ravilious: Green and Pleasant Land,&quot; by Tom Lubbock, ''The Independent,'' 13 July 2010.].

===Revolution===
Several of Blake's poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: &quot;As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)&quot;. He retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, but was often forced to resort to cloaking social idealism and political statements in Protestant mystical [[allegory]]. Even though the poem was written during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Blake was an outspoken supporter of the [[French Revolution]], and [[Napoleon]] claimed to be continuing this revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRblake.htm William Blake] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705065137/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRblake.htm |date=5 July 2008 }} Spartacus Educational (schoolnet.co) – Accessed 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The poem expressed his desire for radical change without overt sedition. In 1803 Blake was charged at [[Chichester]] with high treason for having &quot;uttered seditious and treasonable expressions&quot;, but was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/wblake.htm |title=William Blake |website=Books and Writers |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20120126033604/http%3A//www%2Ekirjasto%2Esci%2Efi/wblake%2Ehtm |archivedate= 26 January 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is followed in the preface by a quotation from ''[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]'' ch. 11, v. 29: &lt;!-- rendered literatim per [[WP:QUOTE]]; do not add apostrophe --&gt;&quot;Would to God that all the Lords people were prophets.&quot; [[Christopher Rowland (theologian)|Christopher Rowland]] has argued that this includes

&lt;blockquote&gt;everyone in the task of speaking out about what they saw. Prophecy for Blake, however, was not a prediction of the end of the world, but telling the truth as best a person can about what he or she sees, fortified by insight and an &quot;honest persuasion&quot; that with personal struggle, things could be improved. A human being observes, is indignant and speaks out: it's a basic political maxim which is necessary for any age. Blake wanted to stir people from their intellectual slumbers, and the daily grind of their toil, to see that they were captivated in the grip of a culture which kept them thinking in ways which served the interests of the powerful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowland&quot;&gt;Rowland, C. 2007 [http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/arts_culture/literature/william_blake_visionary William Blake: a visionary for our time] openDemocracy.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Popularisation==
{{See also|William Blake in popular culture}}

The poem, which was little known during the century which followed its writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://archive.org/details/jerusalemjerusal0000carr |url-access = registration |page = [https://archive.org/details/jerusalemjerusal0000carr/page/236 236]|title = Jerusalem, Jerusalem: How the Ancient City Ignited Our Modern World|first = James|last = Carroll|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-547-19561-2|authorlink = James Carroll (novelist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; was included in the patriotic anthology of verse ''The Spirit of Man,'' edited by the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], [[Robert Bridges]], and published in 1916, at a time when morale had begun to decline because of the high number of casualties in World War I and the perception that there was no end in sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Spirit of Man: An Anthology in English &amp; French from the Philosophers &amp; Poets|date = January 1916|url = https://archive.org/stream/spiritofmanantho00bridiala#page/n5/mode/2up|chapterurl = https://archive.org/stream/spiritofmanantho00bridiala#page/n335/mode/2up|page = 335|publisher = Longmans, Green &amp; Co.|accessdate =10 September 2012|editor-first = Robert|editor-last = Bridges|editor-link = Robert Bridges|chapter = Index|edition = First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these circumstances, Bridges, finding the poem an appropriate hymn text to &quot;brace the spirit of the nation [to] accept with cheerfulness all the sacrifices necessary,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://archive.org/details/jerusalemjerusal0000carr |url-access = registration |page = [https://archive.org/details/jerusalemjerusal0000carr/page/235 235]|title = Jerusalem, Jerusalem: How the Ancient City Ignited Our Modern World|first = James|last = Carroll|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-547-19561-2|authorlink = James Carroll (novelist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked [[Hubert Parry|Sir Hubert Parry]] to put it to music for a [[Fight for Right Movement|Fight for Right campaign]] meeting in London's [[Queen's Hall]]. Bridges asked Parry to supply &quot;suitable, simple music to Blake's stanzas – music that an audience could take up and join in&quot;, and added that, if Parry could not do it himself, he might delegate the task to [[George Butterworth]].&lt;ref&gt;C. L.Graves, Hubert Parry, Macmillan 1926, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem's idealistic [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or [[subtext]] accounts for its popularity across much of the political spectrum. It was used as a campaign slogan by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]; [[Clement Attlee]] said they would build &quot;a new Jerusalem&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/tr_show01.html |title=Link to PBS script quoting Attlee in 1945 – Accessed 7 August 2008 |publisher=Pbs.org |date=24 October 1929 |accessdate=29 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110516015358/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/tr_show01.html| archivedate= 16 May 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been sung at conferences of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], at the [[Glee Club (British politics)|Glee Club]] of the British [[Liberal Assembly]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100152734/what-does-it-really-mean-to-be-english-nothing-at-all-and-thats-how-it-should-be/ | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=What does it really mean to be English? Nothing at all – and that's how it should be | date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parry's setting of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;===
In adapting Blake's poem as a [[unison]] song, Parry deployed a two-[[stanza]] format, each taking up eight lines of Blake's original poem. He added a four-bar musical introduction to each verse and a [[coda (music)|coda]], echoing melodic [[motif (music)|motif]]s of the song. The word &quot;those&quot; was substituted for &quot;these&quot; before &quot;dark satanic mills&quot;.

The piece was to be conducted by Parry's former student [[Walford Davies]], but Parry was initially reluctant to set the words, as he had doubts about the ultra-patriotism of Fight for Right, but not wanting to disappoint either Robert Bridges or Davies he agreed, writing it on 10 March 1916, and handing the manuscript to Davies with the comment, &quot;Here's a tune for you, old chap. Do what you like with it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benoliel, Bernard, Parry Before Jerusalem, Ashgate, Aldershot, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Davies later recalled,

{{quote|We looked at [the manuscript] together in his room at the [[Royal College of Music]], and I recall vividly his unwonted happiness over it&amp;nbsp;... He ceased to speak, and put his finger on the note D in the second stanza where the words 'O clouds unfold' break his rhythm. I do not think any word passed about it, yet he made it perfectly clear that this was the one note and one moment of the song which he treasured&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=&quot;dibble&quot;&gt;Dibble, Jeremy, C. Hubert H. Parry: His life and music, Oxford University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Davies arranged for the vocal score to be published by [[Curwen Press|Curwen]] in time for the concert at the [[Queen's Hall]] on 28 March and began rehearsing it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilt&quot;&gt;Christopher Wiltshire (Former archivist, British Federation of Festivals for Music, Speech and Dance), [https://www.theguardian.com/letters/story/0,3604,408355,00.html Guardian newspaper 8 December 2000 Letters: Tune into Jerusalem's fighting history] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 8 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a success and was taken up generally.

But Parry began to have misgivings again about Fight for Right and eventually wrote to Sir [[Francis Younghusband]] withdrawing his support entirely in May 1917. There was even concern that the composer might withdraw the song, but the situation was saved by [[Millicent Fawcett]] of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS). The song had been taken up by the Suffragists in 1917 and Fawcett asked Parry if it might be used at a Suffrage Demonstration Concert on 13 March 1918. Parry was delighted and orchestrated the piece for the concert (it had originally been for voices and organ). After the concert, Fawcett asked the composer if it might become the Women Voters' Hymn. Parry wrote back,

{{quote|I wish indeed it might become the Women Voters' hymn, as you suggest. People seem to enjoy singing it. And having the vote ought to diffuse a good deal of joy too. So they would combine happily.&lt;ref name=&quot;dibble&quot;/&gt;}}

Accordingly, he assigned the copyright to the NUWSS. When that organisation was wound up in 1928, Parry's executors reassigned the copyright to the [[Women's Institutes]], where it remained until it entered the public domain in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;dibble&quot;/&gt;

The song was first called &quot;And Did Those Feet in Ancient Time&quot; and the early published scores have this title. The change to &quot;Jerusalem&quot; seems to have been made about the time of the 1918 Suffrage Demonstration Concert, perhaps when the orchestral score was published (Parry's manuscript of the orchestral score has the old title crossed out and &quot;Jerusalem&quot; inserted in a different hand).&lt;ref&gt;The manuscripts of the song with organ and with orchestra, and of Elgar's orchestration, are in the library of the Royal College of Music, London&lt;/ref&gt; However, Parry always referred to it by its first title. He had originally intended the first verse to be sung by a solo female voice (this is marked in the score), but this is rare in contemporary performances. Sir [[Edward Elgar]] re-scored the work for very large orchestra in 1922 for use at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICONS2&quot;&gt;ICONS – a portrait of England. Icon: Jerusalem (hymn) [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/biography/sir-hubert-parry Sir Hubert Parry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809003129/http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/biography/sir-hubert-parry |date=9 August 2011 }}, &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and Elgar's orchestration.&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar's orchestration has overshadowed Parry's own, primarily because it is the version usually used now for the [[Last Night of the Proms]] (though Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]], who introduced it to that event in the 1950s, always used Parry's version).

===Use as a hymn===
Although Parry composed the music as a unison song, many churches have adopted &quot;Jerusalem&quot; as a four-part hymn; a number of English entities, including the BBC, the Crown, cathedrals, churches, and chapels regularly use it as an office or recessional hymn on [[Saint George's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;On its being played at King George V opening the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, &quot;British Table Talk&quot;, ''Christian Century'' (22 May 1924): 663; and Rubert Speaight, &quot;England and St. George: A programme for St. George's Day [3 May], 1943&quot;, ''London Calling'' 169 (May 1943), iv.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

However, some clergy in the Church of England, according to the [[BBC TV]] programme ''Jerusalem: An Anthem for England'', have said that the song is not technically a [[hymn]] as it is not a prayer to God (which they claim hymns always are, though many counter-examples appear in any hymnal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Jerusalem: An Anthem for England |date=8 July 2007 |publisher=[[BBC Four]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074rmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is not sung in some churches in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Retrieved 29 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many schools use the song, especially [[Public school (UK)|public school]]s in Great Britain (it was used as the title music for the [[BBC]]'s 1979 series ''Public School'' at [[Radley College]]), and several private schools in Australia, New Zealand, New England and Canada. &quot;Jerusalem&quot; was chosen as the opening hymn for the [[London Olympics 2012]], although &quot;[[God Save the Queen]]&quot; was the anthem sung during the raising of the flag in salute to the Queen. Some attempts have also been made to increase its use elsewhere with other words; examples include the State Funeral of President Ronald Reagan in Washington National Cathedral on 11 June 2004 and the State Memorial Service for Australian Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] on 5 November 2014.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Use as a national anthem===

However, some sports, including [[rugby league]], use &quot;Jerusalem&quot; as the English anthem. &quot;Jerusalem&quot; is the official hymn of the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthem4england.co.uk/category/correspondence/ |title= Correspondence |publisher=Anthem 4 England | location = UK |date= 8 May 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was the anthem sung before England's games in [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]], the [[2010–11 Ashes series]] and the [[2019 ICC Cricket World Cup]]. Questions in [[British Parliament|Parliament]] have not clarified the situation, as answers from the relevant minister say that since there is no official national anthem, each sport must make its own decision.

As Parliament has not clarified the situation, Team England, the English Commonwealth team, held a public poll in 2010 to decide which anthem should be played at medal ceremonies to celebrate an English win at the Commonwealth Games. &quot;Jerusalem&quot; was selected by 52% of voters over &quot;[[Land of Hope and Glory]]&quot; (used since 1930) and &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sir Andrew Foster |url=http://www.weareengland.org/news.asp?itemid=327&amp;itemTitle=England+announce+victory+anthem+for+Delhi+chosen+by+the+public%21&amp;section=115&amp;sectionTitle=News |title=England announce victory anthem for Delhi chosen by the public! – Commonwealth Games England |publisher=Weare England |date=30 May 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611162431/http://www.weareengland.org/news.asp?itemid=327&amp;itemTitle=England+announce+victory+anthem+for+Delhi+chosen+by+the+public%21&amp;section=115&amp;sectionTitle=News |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, for their ''[[Brain Salad Surgery]]'' album, British progressive rock band [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] recorded a version of the song titled &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. The track features the debut of the prototype [[Moog Apollo]], the first-ever [[polyphonic synthesizer|polyphonic music synthesizer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lake&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ladiesofthelake.com/cabinet/bssliner.html|title=Liner Notes from the DVD-A of Brain Salad Surgery|publisher=Ladies of the Lake – A Greg Lake Tribute Site|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter of this song indicates a nod to ELP's unabashed Englishness and simultaneously lent an air of timeless tradition and ceremony to the music. Though a single was released of the song, it failed to chart, and it was banned from radio play in England. The BBC would not accept it as a serious piece of music, the band claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lake&quot;/&gt; Drummer [[Carl Palmer]] later expressed disappointment over this decision.
{{quote|We wanted to put it out as a single&amp;nbsp;... We figured it was worthy of a single. In England, they have this format where four or five people have to [approve it] before it gets played on the airwaves; it's a very old-fashioned way of doing it, but that's the way it was being done at the time. I think there was some apprehension [as] to whether or not we should be playing a hymn and bastardizing it, as they said, or whatever was being called at the time&amp;nbsp;... We thought we'd done it spot-on, and I thought that was very sad because I've got a jukebox at home, and that's a piece of music that I've got on the jukebox, so I actually thought the recording and just the general performances from all of us were absolutely wonderful. I couldn't believe the small-mindedness of the English&amp;nbsp;... committee to vote these things onto the radio or off the radio. They&amp;nbsp;... obviously didn't even listen to this. It got banned and there was sort of quite a big thing about it, these people just would not play it. They said no, it was a hymn, and we had taken it the wrong way.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}}}

A live rendition was recorded during their subsequent ''Someone Get Me a Ladder'' tour, and was included on the live album of the band's 1974 tour ''[[Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ~ Ladies and Gentlemen|Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ~ Ladies and Gentlemen...

The popularity of Parry's setting has resulted in many hundreds of recordings being made, too numerous to list, of both traditional choral performances and new interpretations by popular music artists. Consequently, only its most notable performances are listed below.
*'''Annually'''—It is sung every year by an audience of thousands at the end of the [[Last Night of the Proms]] in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and simultaneously in the ''Proms in the Park'' venues throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|041nXAAn714}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Annually'''—Along with &quot;[[The Red Flag]]&quot;, it is sung each year at the closing of the annual [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference.
*'''Annually'''—It is traditionally sung before [[rugby league]]'s [[Challenge Cup]] Final, along with &quot;[[Abide with Me]]&quot;, and before the [[Super League Grand Final]], where it is introduced as &quot;the rugby league anthem&quot;. Before 2008, it was the anthem used by the [[England national rugby league team|national side]], as &quot;[[God Save the Queen]]&quot; was used by [[Great Britain national rugby league team|the Great Britain team]]: since the Lions were superseded by England, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; has replaced &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.
*'''1920s'''—The song was used by the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (indeed it was their property until 1928, when they were wound up after women won the right to vote – see above in relation to Millicent Garret Fawcett).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=8553 |title=Link to SongFacts – Accessed 7 August 2008 |publisher=Songfacts.com |accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, many [[Women's Institutes]] (WI) started closing meetings by singing it, and this caught on nationally. Although it has never actually been adopted as the WI's official anthem, in practice it holds that position, and is an enduring element of the public image of the WI.&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;Jam and ''Jerusalem''&quot; caricature of the WI is still current enough that they have a [[FAQ]] about it on their site at [http://www.thewi.org.uk/standard.aspx?id=12466] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111082408/http://www.thewi.org.uk/standard.aspx?id=12466 |date=11 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1986'''—[[The Waterboys]] have incorporated verses into live performances of &quot;Savage Earth Heart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=GG7Do74zUWI#t=7m21s|title=The Waterboys using verses from Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1991'''—The extended version of dance group [[The KLF]]'s hit single &quot;[[It's Grim Up North]]&quot; incorporates Parry's setting of the poem.

&quot;Bring me my Chariot of fire&quot; inspired the title of the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;welland&quot;&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/trivia IMDb trivia – Origin of title] – Accessed 11 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A church congregation sings &quot;Jerusalem&quot; at the close of the film and a performance appears on the ''[[Chariots of Fire (album)|Chariots of Fire soundtrack]]'' performed by the [[Ambrosian Singers]] overlaid partly by a composition by [[Vangelis]]. One unexpected touch is that &quot;Jerusalem&quot; is sung in four-part harmony, as if it were truly a hymn. This is not authentic: Parry's composition was a unison song (that is, all voices sing the tune – perhaps one of the things that make it so &quot;singable&quot; by massed crowds) and he never provided any harmonisation other than the accompaniment for organ (or orchestra). Neither does it appear in any standard hymn book in a guise other than Parry's own, so it may have been harmonised specially for the film. The film's working title was &quot;Running&quot; until [[Colin Welland]] saw a television programme, ''[[Songs of Praise]]'', featuring the hymn and decided to change the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;welland&quot; /&gt;

The hymn has featured in many other films and television programmes including ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[How to Get Ahead in Advertising]]'', ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'', ''[[Calendar Girls]]'', Season 3: Episode 22 of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Goodnight Mister Tom (1998 film)|Goodnight Mr. Tom]]'', ''[[Women in Love]]'', ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]'', ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] ''. An extract was heard in the 2013 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode &quot;[[The Crimson Horror]]&quot; although that story was set in 1893, i.e., before Parry's arrangement. A punk version is heard in [[Derek Jarman]]'s 1977 film ''[[Jubilee (1978 film)|Jubilee]]''. In an episode of ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', Jez ([[Robert Webb]]) records a track titled &quot;This Is Outrageous&quot; which uses the first and a version of the second line in a verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ySqtuxadnn4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modified version of the hymn, replacing the word &quot;England&quot; with &quot;Neo&quot;, is used in ''[[Neo Yokio]]'' as the national anthem of the eponymous city state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/neo-yokio/.121543|title=Neo Yokio Review|first=Mike|last=Toole|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=September 19, 2017|accessdate=September 26, 2017|quote=Neo Yokio's national anthem is William Blake's 'Jerusalem,' and fight scenes are underpinned by tunes by the likes of Mingus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theatre it appears in ''[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; ''[[Calendar Girls]]'' and in ''[[Time and the Conways]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; Eddie Izzard discusses the hymn in his 2000 ''[[Circle (Eddie Izzard)|Circle]]'' stand-up tour. Punk band [[Bad Religion]] have borrowed the opening line of Blake's poem in their &quot;God Song&quot;, from the 1990 album ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]''.

Blake's lyrics have also been set to music by other composers without reference to Parry's melody. [[Tim Blake]] (synthesiser player of [[Gong (band)|Gong]]) produced a solo album in 1978 called ''[[Blake's New Jerusalem]]'', including a 20-minute track with lyrics from Blake's poem. [[Mark E. Smith]] of [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] interpolated the verses with a deadpan rant against his native land in the track &quot;Dog is life/Jerusalem&quot; from the 1988 ballet score &quot;[[I Am Kurious Oranj]]&quot;. The words, with some variations, are used in the track &quot;Jerusalem&quot; on [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s album ''[[The Chemical Wedding (Bruce Dickinson album)|The Chemical Wedding]]'', which also includes lines from book two of ''Milton''. [[Finn Coren]] also created a different musical setting for the poem on his album ''[[The Blake Project: Spring]]''. [[The Verve]] also referenced the song in their 2008 song ''[[Love Is Noise]]'' from the album [[Forth (album)|Forth.]] Lead singer and writer [[Richard Ashcroft]] said that Blake had influenced the lyric ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Will those feet in modern times''' from the song.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rXLSWrFVqg The Verve – Love is Noise (Interview) – &quot;L''ook at it in the first few lines, as a kind of remake of Jerusalem by William Blake, rather than those feet in ancient times, its those feet in modern times.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the first Verve song influenced by Blake, as their previous single ''[[History (The Verve song)|History]]'' also featured the lyrics &quot;I wandered lonely streets/Behind where the old Thames does flow/And in every face I meet&quot;, referencing Blake's &quot;[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]&quot;
It is often thought that in the song “feel good inc” by Gorrilaz, the lyrics “windmill windmill for the land love forever hand in hand” is about the satanic mills in Blake's poem.

'''''A Little Night Music''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by  [[Stephen Sondheim]] and book by [[Hugh Wheeler]]. Inspired by the [[Ingmar Bergman]] film ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'', it involves the romantic lives of several couples. Its title is a literal English translation of the German name for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Eine kleine Nachtmusik|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], ''Eine kleine Nachtmusik''. The musical includes the popular song &quot;[[Send In the Clowns]]&quot;.

Since its original 1973 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, the musical has enjoyed professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]], by opera companies, in a 2009 Broadway revival, and elsewhere, and it is a popular choice for regional groups. It was [[A Little Night Music (film)|adapted for film in 1977]], with [[Harold Prince]] directing and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]], and [[Diana Rigg]] starring.

==Synopsis==
===Act One===
The setting is [[Sweden]], around the year 1900. One by one, the Quintet – five singers who comment like a [[Greek chorus]] throughout the show – enter, tuning up. Gradually, their vocalizing becomes an overture blending fragments of &quot;Remember&quot;, &quot;Soon&quot; and &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot;, leading into the first &quot;Night Waltz&quot;. The other characters enter [[waltz]]ing, each uncomfortable with her partner. After they drift back off, the aging and sardonic Madame Armfeldt and her solemn granddaughter, Fredrika, enter. Madame Armfeldt tells the child that the summer night &quot;smiles&quot; three times: first on the young, second on fools, and third on the old. Fredrika vows to watch the smiles occur. Middle-aged Fredrik Egerman is a successful lawyer. He has recently married an 18-year-old [[trophy wife]], Anne, a naive girl who loves Fredrik but is too immature to grasp the concept of marriage. The two have been married for eleven months, but Anne still protects her [[virginity]]. Fredrik plots how he might [[seduce]] his wife (&quot;Now&quot;). Meanwhile, his son Henrik, a [[seminary]] student a year older than his stepmother, is frustrated and ignored (&quot;Later&quot;). Anne promises her husband that shortly she will consent to have sex (&quot;Soon&quot;), which leads into all three of them lamenting at once. Anne's [[maidservant]] Petra, an experienced and forthright girl, slightly older than the teen herself, offers her worldly but crass advice.

Desiree Armfeldt is a prominent and glamorous actress who is now reduced to touring in small towns. Madam Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, has taken over the care of Desiree's daughter Fredrika. Fredrika misses her mother, but Desiree continually delays going to see her, preferring, somewhat ironically, &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot;. She is performing near Fredrik's home, and Fredrik brings Anne to see the play. While there, Desiree notices Fredrik in the audience; the two had been lovers years earlier. Anne, suspicious and annoyed at Desiree's amorous glances, demands that Fredrik take her home immediately. Meanwhile, Petra tries to seduce a nervous and petulant Henrik.

That night, as Fredrik remembers his past with Desiree, he sneaks out to see her; the two have a happy but strained reunion as they &quot;Remember&quot;. They reflect on their new lives, and Fredrik tries to explain how much he loves Anne (&quot;You Must Meet My Wife&quot;). Desiree responds sarcastically and boasts of her own adultery, as she has been seeing the married [[dragoon]], Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. Upon learning that Fredrik has gone for eleven months without sex, she agrees to accommodate him as a favor for an old friend.

Madam Armfeldt offers advice to young Fredrika. The elderly woman reflects poignantly on her own checkered past, and wonders what happened to her refined &quot;Liaisons&quot;. Back in Desiree's apartment, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm proclaims his unannounced arrival in his usual booming tones. Fredrik and Desiree fob off the Count with an innocent explanation for their disheveled appearance, but he is still suspicious. He instantly dislikes Fredrik and returns to his wife, Countess Charlotte. Charlotte is quite aware of her husband's infidelity, but Carl-Magnus is too absorbed in his suspicions of Desiree to talk to her (&quot;In Praise of Women&quot;). When she persuades him to blurt out the whole story, a twist is revealed&amp;mdash;Charlotte's little sister is a schoolfriend of Anne's.

Charlotte visits Anne and describes Fredrik's tryst with Desiree. Anne is shocked and saddened, but Charlotte explains that such is the lot of a wife, and love brings pain (&quot;Every Day a Little Death&quot;). Meanwhile, Desiree asks Madame Armfeldt to host a party for Fredrik, Anne and Henrik. Though reluctant, Madam Armfeldt agrees. She sends out a personal invitation; its receipt sends Anne into a frenzy, imagining &quot;A Weekend in the Country&quot; with the Armfeldts. Anne does not want to accept the invitation, but Charlotte convinces her to do so to heighten the contrast between the older woman and the young and beautiful teenager. Charlotte relates this to the Count, who (much to her chagrin) decides to visit the Armfeldts uninvited. Carl-Magnus plans to challenge Fredrik to a [[duel]], while Charlotte hopes to seduce the lawyer to make her husband jealous and end his philandering. The act ends as all characters set off to Madam Armfeldt's estate.

===Act Two===
Madam Armfeldt's country estate is bathed in the golden glow of perpetual summer sunset at this high latitude (&quot;Night Waltz One and Two&quot;). Everyone arrives, each with their own amorous purposes and desires—even Petra, who catches the eye of Armfeldt's fetching [[manservant]], Frid. The women begin to quarrel with one another. Fredrik is astonished to learn the name of Desiree's daughter. Henrik meets Fredrika, and confesses his deep love for Anne to her. Meanwhile, in the garden, Fredrik and Carl-Magnus reflect on how difficult it is to be annoyed with Desiree, agreeing &quot;It Would Have Been Wonderful&quot; had she not been quite so wonderful. Dinner is served, and the characters' &quot;Perpetual Anticipation&quot; enlivens the meal.

At dinner, Charlotte attempts to flirt with Fredrik, and trades insults with Desiree. Soon, everyone is shouting and scolding everyone else, except for Henrik, who finally speaks up. He accuses the whole company of being [[amorality|amoral]], and flees the scene. Stunned, everyone reflects on the situation and wanders away. Fredrika tells Anne of Henrik's secret love, and the two dash off searching for him. Meanwhile, Desiree meets Fredrik and asks if he still wants to be &quot;rescued&quot; from his life. Fredrik answers honestly that he loves Desiree, but cannot bring himself to part with Anne. Hurt and bitter, Desiree can only reflect on the nature of her life and relationship to Fredrik (&quot;[[Send In the Clowns]]&quot;). Anne finds Henrik, who is attempting to commit suicide. The clumsy boy cannot complete the task, and Anne tells him that she loves him, too. The pair begins to kiss, which leads to Anne's first sexual encounter. Meanwhile, not far away, Frid sleeps in Petra's lap. The maid imagines advantageous marriages, but concludes that in the meantime, &quot;a girl ought to celebrate what passes by&quot; (&quot;The Miller's Son&quot;). Charlotte confesses her plan to Fredrik, and both watch as Henrik and Anne, happy together, run away to start their new life. The two commiserate on a bench. Carl-Magnus, preparing to romance Desiree, sees this and challenges Fredrik to [[Russian Roulette]], at which a nervous Fredrik misfires and simply grazes his own ear. Victorious, Carl-Magnus begins to romance Charlotte, granting her wish at last.

After the Count and Countess leave, Fredrika and Madam Armfeldt discuss the chaos of the recent turns-of-events. The elderly woman then asks Fredrika a surprising question: &quot;What is it all for?&quot; Fredrika thinks about this, and decides that love, for all of its frustrations, &quot;must be worth it&quot;. Madam Armfeldt is surprised, ruefully noting that she rejected love for material wealth at Fredrika's age. She praises her granddaughter and remembers true love's fleeting nature.

Fredrik finally confesses his love for Desiree, acknowledging that Fredrika is his daughter, and the two promise to start a new life together (&quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; (Reprise)). Madam Armfeldt sits alone with Fredrika. Fredrika tells her grandmother that she has watched carefully, but still has not seen the night smile. Madam Armfeldt laughs and points out that the night has indeed smiled twice: first on Henrik and Anne, the young, and second on Desiree and Fredrik, the fools. As the two wait for the &quot;third smile... on the old&quot;, it occurs: Madam Armfeldt closes her eyes, and dies peacefully with Fredrika beside her.

*'''Countess Charlotte Malcolm''': Carl-Magnus' wife, to whom he flaunts his infidelities. She despises her husband for his behaviour, but obeys his orders due to her hopeless love for him.

New York City Opera's production in August 1990 and July 1991 (a total of 18 performances) won the 1990 [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival]] and was telecast on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] show ''Live at Lincoln Center'' on November 7, 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359610/?ref_=rvi_tt |title=Imdb|accessdate=2014-11-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609214139/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359610/?ref_=rvi_tt |archivedate=2015-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast included both stage performers: [[Sally Ann Howes]] and George Lee Andrews as Desiree and Frederick and opera regular [[Regina Resnik]] as Madame Armfeldt (in 1991).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/night.html#1990NYCO 1990 New York City Opera Production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513233106/http://www.sondheimguide.com/night.html |date=2017-05-13 }} sondheimguide.com, accessed October 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 production featured a young [[Anna Kendrick]] as Fredrika Armfeldt, alongside [[Jeremy Irons]] as Frederick, [[Juliet Stevenson]] as Desiree, [[Claire Bloom]] as Madame Armfeldt, [[Danny Gurwin]] as Henrik, [[Michele Pawk]] as Charlotte, and [[Marc Kudisch]] as Carl-Magnus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/night.html#2003NYCO 2003 New York City Opera Production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513233106/http://www.sondheimguide.com/night.html |date=2017-05-13 }} sondheimguide.com, accessed October 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Opera Australia]] presented the piece in Melbourne in May 2009, starring [[Sigrid Thornton]] as Desiree Armfeldt and Nacye Hayes as Madame Armfeldt. The production returned in 2010 at the Sydney Opera House with [[Anthony Warlow]] taking on the role of Fredrik Egerman. The production was directed by Stuart Maunder, designed by Roger Kirk, and conducted by Andrew Greene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera-australia.org.au/scripts/nc.dll?OPRA:PRODUCTION:0:pc=PC_90107 ''A Little Night Music''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303061205/http://www.opera-australia.org.au/scripts/nc.dll?OPRA:PRODUCTION:0:pc=PC_90107 |date=2012-03-03 }}, [[Opera Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]] performed the musical in June 2010.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|A Little Night Music (film)}}
A film version of ''[[A Little Night Music (1977 film)|A Little Night Music]]'' was released in 1977, starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]] and [[Diana Rigg]], with [[Len Cariou]], [[Hermione Gingold]] and [[Laurence Guittard]] reprising their Broadway roles. The setting for the film was moved from Sweden to Austria. [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote lyrics for the &quot;Night Waltz&quot; theme (&quot;Love Takes Time&quot;) and wrote an entirely new version of &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot;, which has been incorporated into several subsequent productions of the stage musical. However, other songs, including &quot;In Praise of Women&quot;, &quot;The Miller's Son&quot; and &quot;Liaisons&quot;, were cut and remain heard only as background orchestrations. The film marked Broadway director [[Hal Prince]]'s second time as a motion picture director. Critical reaction to the film was mostly negative, with much being made of Taylor's wildly fluctuating weight from scene to scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/08/archives/film-a-little-night-musicbergmaninspired.html|title=Film: 'A Little Night Music': Bergman-Inspired|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 8, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics talked more positively of the film, with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' calling it &quot;an elegant looking, period romantic charade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1976/film/reviews/a-little-night-music-4-1200424049/|title=A Little Night Music|magazine=Variety|accessdate=May 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was praise for Diana Rigg's performance, and orchestrator [[Jonathan Tunick]] received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his work on the score. A soundtrack recording was released on LP, and a DVD release was issued in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0076319|title=A Little Night Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music analysis==
The score for ''A Little Night Music'' has elements not often found in musical theater, presenting challenges for performers, with complex meters, pitch changes, polyphony, and high notes for both males and females. The difficulty is heightened when songs merge, as in &quot;Now&quot;/&quot;Later&quot;/&quot;Soon&quot;, because all three have to be performed in the same key, limiting the ability to pick a comfortable key for each singer. Critic [[Rex Reed]] noted that &quot;The score of 'Night Music' ...contains patter songs, contrapuntal duets and trios, a quartet, and even a dramatic double quintet to puzzle through. All this has been gorgeously orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick; there is no rhythm section, only strings and woodwinds to carry the melodies and harmonies aloft.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Didier C.[http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/a-little-night-music &quot;'A Little Night Music' Liner Notes, Song List and Synopsis&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105094459/http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/a-little-night-music |date=2011-01-05 }} masterworksbroadway.com, retrieved June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondheim's engagement with threes extends to his lyrics. He organizes trios with the singers separated, while his duets are sung together, about a third person.&lt;ref name=&quot;tunick&quot; /&gt;

The work is performed as an [[operetta]] in many professional opera companies. For example, it was added to the [[New York City Opera]] Company repertoire in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Kay. &quot;Broadway Musicals, Show By Show&quot; (1996).

==={{music|time|3|4}} time===
Virtually all of the music in the show is written in [[waltz]] meter ([[Triple time|{{music|time|3|4}} time]]). Some parts adopt [[Compound meter (music)|compound meter]], with a [[time signature]] such as {{music|time|12|8}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;tunick&quot;&gt;

===Counterpoint and polyphony===
At several points, Sondheim has multiple performers each sing a different song simultaneously. This use of [[counterpoint]] maintains coherence even as it extends the notion of a [[round (music)|round]], familiar in songs such as the traditional &quot;[[Frère Jacques]]&quot;, into something more complex. Sondheim said: &quot;As for the three songs ... going together well, I might as well confess. In those days I was just getting into contrapuntal and choral writing...and I wanted to develop my technique by writing a trio. What I didn't want to do is the [[quodlibet]] method...wouldn't it be nice to have three songs you don't think are going to go together, and they do go together ... The trick was the little [[vamp (music)|vamp]] on &quot;Soon&quot; which has five-and six-note chords.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;swayne&quot;&gt;Swayne, Steve. ''How Sondheim Found His Sound'', University of Michigan Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-472-03229-1}}, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Swayne comments that the &quot;contrapuntal episodes in the extended ensembles ... stand as testament to his interest in Counterpoint.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;swayne&quot; /&gt;

===&quot;Send In The Clowns&quot;===
The show's best-known and Sondheim's biggest hit song was almost an afterthought, written several days before the start of out-of-town tryouts.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Sondheim initially conceived Desiree as a role for a more or less non-singing actress. When he discovered that the original Desiree, [[Glynis Johns]], was able to sing (she had a &quot;small, silvery voice&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;secrest&quot;&gt;Secrest, Meryle. &quot;Stephen Sondheim: A Life&quot; (1998). Dell Publishing. {{ISBN|0-385-33412-5}}, pp. 251–252&lt;/ref&gt; but could not &quot;sustain a phrase&quot;, he devised the song &quot;[[Send in the Clowns]]&quot; for her in a way that would work around her vocal weakness, e.g., by ending lines with consonants that made for a short cut-off.&lt;ref name=&quot;secrest&quot; /&gt; &quot;It is written in short phrases in order to be acted rather than sung ... tailor-made for Glynis Johns, who lacks the vocal power to sustain long phrases.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sondheim, S., Shevelove, B., Gelbart, L., Wheeler, H., and Lapine, J.  &quot;Four by Sondheim, Wheeler, Lapine, Shevelove and Gelbart&quot; (2000). Hal Leonard Corporation. {{ISBN|1-55783-407-5}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In analyzing the text of the song, [[Max Cryer]] wrote that it &quot;is not intended to be sung by the young in love, but by a mature performer who has seen it all before. The song remains an anthem to regret for unwise decisions in the past and recognition that there's no need to send in the clowns – they're already here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cryer, Max. ''Love Me Tender: The Stories Behind the World's Best-loved Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7112-2911-2}}, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham Wolfe has argued, &quot;What Desirée is referring to in the famous song is a conventional device to cover over a moment when something has gone wrong on stage. Midway through the second Act she has deviated from her usual script by suggesting to Fredrik the possibility of being together seriously and permanently, and, having been rejected, she falters ''as'' a show-person, finds herself bereft of the capacity to improvise and wittily cover. If Desirée could perform at this moment – revert to the innuendos, one-liners and blithe self-referential humour that constitutes her normal character – all would be well. She cannot, and what follows is an exemplary manifestation of Sondheim’s musico-dramatic complexity, his inclination to write music that performs drama. That is, what needs to be covered over (by the clowns sung about in the song) is the very intensity, ragged emotion and utter vulnerability that comes forward through the music and singing itself, a display protracted to six minutes, wrought with exposed silences, a shocked Fredrik sitting so uncomfortably before Desirée while something much too real emerges in a realm where he – and his audience – felt assured of performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Graham. &quot;Sondheim's ''A Little Night Music'': Reconciling the Comic and the Sublime.&quot; ''Studies in Musical Theatre'' 8.2 (2014): 143–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
There is a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] reference in the title&amp;mdash;''A Little Night Music'' is an occasionally-used translation of ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', the nickname of Mozart's [[Serenade No. 13 (Mozart)|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 525. The elegant, [[harmony|harmonically]]-advanced music in this musical pays indirect homage to the compositions of [[Maurice Ravel]], especially his ''[[Valses nobles et sentimentales (Ravel)|Valses nobles et sentimentales]]''&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Stephen. pp. 200, 203&lt;/ref&gt; (whose opening chord is borrowed for the opening chord of the song &quot;Liaisons&quot;); part of this effect stems from the style of orchestration that [[Jonathan Tunick]] used. There is also a direct quotation in 'A Weekend in the Country' (just as it moves to A{{music|b}} major) of Octavian's theme from Strauss' 'Der Rosenkavalier', another comedy of manners with partner-swapping at its heart.

==Critical response==
In his review of the original 1973 Broadway production, [[Clive Barnes]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the musical &quot;heady, civilized, sophisticated and enchanting.&quot; He noted that &quot;the real triumph belongs to Stephen Sondheim...the music is a celebration of 3/4 time, an orgy of plaintively memorable waltzes, all talking of past loves and lost worlds...There is a peasant touch here.&quot; He commented that the lyrics are &quot;breathtaking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Clive, &quot;The Theater:'A Little Night Music&quot;, ''The New York Times'', February 26, 1973, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In its review of the 1989 London revival, the reviewer for ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that the &quot;production also strikes me as infinitely superior to Harold Prince's 1975 version at the Adelphi. Mr Judge's great innovation is to transform the Liebeslieder Singers from the evening-dressed, after-dinner line-up into 18th century ghosts weaving in and out of the action...But Mr Judge's other great realisation is that, in Sondheim, the lyrics are not an adornment to a song but their very essence: understand them and the show will flow. Thus Dorothy Tutin as Desiree, the touring thesp eventually reunited with her quondam lover, is not the melting romantic of previous productions but a working mother with the sharpness of a hat-pin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Billington, Michael. &quot;Arts: Night of the short memories - 'A Little Night Music'&quot;, ''The Guardian'' (London)., October 23, 1989 (no page number)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' review of the 1995 National Theatre revival praised the production, writing &quot;For three hours of gloriously barbed bliss and bewitchment, Sean Mathias's production establishes the show as a minor miracle of astringent worldly wisdom and one that is haunted by less earthy intimations.&quot; The review went on to state that &quot;The heart of the production, in both senses, is Judi Dench's superb Desiree Armfeldt...Her husky-voiced rendering of &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; is the most moving I've ever heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Paul and Seckerson, Edward.[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/double-take-reviews-a-little-night-music-1603205.html &quot;Double Take: Reviews: 'A Little Night Music'&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116184311/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/double-take-reviews-a-little-night-music-1603205.html |date=2017-01-16 }}''Independent', September 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the 2008 Menier Chocolate Factory production, the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' reviewer wrote that &quot;Sondheim's lyrics are often superbly witty, his music here, mostly in haunting waltz-time, far more accessible than is sometimes the case. The score positively throbs with love, regret and desire.&quot; But of the specific production, the reviewer went on to note: &quot;But Nunn's production, on one of those hermetic sets largely consisting of doors and tarnished mirrors that have become such a cliché in recent years, never penetrates the work's subtly erotic heart. And as is often the case with this director's work, the pace is so slow and the mood so reverent, that initial enchantment gives way to bored fidgeting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot; /&gt;

In his ''New York Times'' review of the 2009 Broadway production, [[Ben Brantley]] noted that &quot;the expression that hovers over Trevor Nunn's revival...feels dangerously close to a smirk...It is a smirk shrouded in shadows. An elegiac darkness infuses this production.&quot; The production is &quot;sparing on furniture and heavy on shadows&quot;, with &quot;a scaled-down orchestra at lugubriously slowed-down tempos...&quot; He goes on to write that &quot;this somber, less-is-more approach could be effective were the ensemble plugged into the same rueful sensibility. But there is only one moment in this production when all its elements cohere perfectly. That moment, halfway through the first act, belongs to Ms. Lansbury, who has hitherto been perfectly entertaining, playing Madame Armfeldt with the overripe aristocratic condescension of a Lady Bracknell. Then comes her one solo, &quot;Liaisons&quot;, in which her character thinks back on the art of love as a profession in a gilded age, when sex 'was but a pleasurable means to a measurable end.' Her face, with its glamour-gorgon makeup, softens, as Madame Armfeldt seems to melt into memory itself, and the wan stage light briefly appears to borrow radiance from her. It's a lovely example of the past reaching out to the present...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/theater/reviews/14little.html|title=A Weekend in the Country With Eros and Thanatos|last=Brantley|first=Ben|date=2009-12-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313085109/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/theater/reviews/14little.html|archivedate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Suskin, reviewing the new Broadway cast for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', wrote &quot;What a difference a diva makes. Bernadette Peters steps into the six-month-old revival of ''A Little Night Music'' with a transfixing performance, playing it as if she realizes her character's onstage billing -- &quot;the one and only Desiree Armfeldt&quot;—is cliched hyperbole. By figuratively rolling her eyes at the hype, Peters gives us a rich, warm and comedically human Desiree, which reaches full impact when she pierces the facade with a nakedly honest, tears-on-cheek 'Send in the Clowns.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2010/legit/news/a-little-night-music-1117943265/|title=Review: 'A Little Night Music'|last=Suskin|first=Steven|date=2010-08-02|work=Variety|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209025532/https://variety.com/2010/legit/news/a-little-night-music-1117943265/|archivedate=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dual wielding''' is the technique of using two [[weapon]]s, one in each hand, during [[combat]]. It is not a common combat practice. Although historical records of dual wielding in [[war]] are limited, there are numerous [[Martial arts#Variation and scope|weapon-based martial arts]] that involve the use of a pair of weapons. The use of a [[companion weapon]] is sometimes employed in [[European martial arts]] and fencing, such as a parrying dagger. [[Miyamoto Musashi]], a [[Japan]]ese swordsman and ''[[ronin]]'', was said to have conceived of the idea of a particular style of swordsmanship involving the use of two swords.

In terms of [[firearm]]s, especially [[handgun]]s and [[submachine gun]]s, dual wielding is generally denounced by firearm enthusiasts due to its impracticality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlN_4MMTdPs&lt;/ref&gt; Though using two hand guns at a time confers an advantage by allowing more ready ammunition, it is rarely done due to other aspects of weapons handling. Dual wielding has been popularized by fictional works ([[film]], [[television]], and [[video games]]), which have the freedom of ignoring the impracticality of the style, plus the term itself is often invoked in the context of the work.

==History==
Dual wielding has not been used or mentioned much in military history, though it appears in [[Martial arts#Variation and scope|weapon-based martial arts]] and [[fencing]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0PCAgAAQBAJ|title=Schools and Masters of Fencing: From the Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century|last=Castle|first=Egerton|date=2012-06-19|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486138756|page=51|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of weapon combinations in each hand has been mentioned for close combat in western Europe during the [[Byzantine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Byzantine&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Dawson PhD|title=Byzantine Infantryman: Eastern Roman Empire C.900-1204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O14p5hPv8wAC|date=2010|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-105-2|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medieval]], and [[Renaissance era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ShacklefordSpiritofSword&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Shackleford|title=Spirit Of The Sword: A Celebration of Artistry and Craftsmanship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkLaMKl09L8C|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=7 September 2010|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4402-1638-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a [[parrying dagger]] such as a main gauche along with a [[rapier]] is common in historical European martial arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford Medieval warfare&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Clifford Rogers|title=The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzwpq6bLHhMC|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=June 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533403-6|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Traditional schools of [[Japanese martial arts]] include dual wield techniques, particularly a style conceived by [[Miyamoto Musashi]] involving the [[katana]] and [[wakizashi]], two-sword [[kenjutsu]] techniques he called ''[[Niten Ichi-ryū]]''. [[Eskrima]], the traditional martial arts of the Philippines teaches ''Doble Baston'' techniques involving the basic use of a pair of [[rattan sticks]] and also Espada y daga or Sword/Stick and Dagger. [[Okinawan martial arts]] have a method that uses a pair of [[Sai (weapon)|''sai'']].  [[Chinese martial arts]] involve the use of a pair of [[butterfly sword]]s and [[hook sword]]s. [[Gatka]], a weapon-based martial art from the [[Punjab region]], is known to use two sticks at a time. The Thailand weapon-based martial art [[Krabi Krabong]] involves the use of a separate [[Krabi (sword)|''Krabi'']] in each hand. [[Kalaripayattu]] teaches advanced students to use either two sticks (of various sizes) or two daggers or two swords, simultaneously. One of the oldest mentions of dual wielding are the gladiator style known as [[dimachaerus]], where a gladiator would use two swords of the same length, sometimes straight and sometimes crooked midways up the blade.  North American Indian tribes of the Atlantic northeast used a form involving a [[tomahawk]] in the primary hand and [[longknife]] in the secondary.  It is practiced today as part of the modern Cree martial art [[Okichitaw]].

All the above-mentioned examples, involve either one long and one short weapon, or two short weapons.  An example of a dual wield of two sabres is the Ukrainian cossack dance [[hopak]].

The use of a gun in each hand is often associated with the [[American Old West]], mainly due to media portrayals. It was common for people in the era to carry two guns, but not to use them at the same time, as shown in movies. The other pistol was used as a back-up weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;OldwestFactorFilm&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Agnew | title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_mRcTRYcvsC | accessdate=12 June 2013 | year=2012 | publisher=McFarland | isbn=978-0-7864-9311-1 | page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there were several examples of gunmen in the West who actually used two pistols at the same time in their gunfights: 
* [[John Wesley Hardin]] killed a gunman named Benjamin Bradley who shot at him, by drawing both of his pistols and firing back.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, John Wesley (1896). The Life of John Wesley Hardin: As Written By Himself. Seguin, Texas: Smith &amp; Moore. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-1051-6}}. Retrieved March 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mexican vaquero [[Augustine Chacon]] had several gunfights in which he was outnumbered by more than one gunman and prevailed by equipping himself with a revolver in each hand.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R. Michael (2005). Legal Executions in the Western Territories, 1847-1911: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. McFarland. pp. 43-44. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4825-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[King Fisher]] once managed to kill three bandits in a shootout by pulling both of his pistols.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccchaney.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.ccchaney.com/Genealogy/maternal/Damron/FisherJohnKing/kingfisher.html Texas Gunslinger, Outlaw and Lawman].&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the infamous [[Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight]], lawman [[Dallas Stoudenmire]] pulled both of his pistols as he ran out onto the street and killed one bystander and two other gunmen.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Leon Claire. 1979. Dallas Stoudenmire: El Paso Marshal. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press. 162 p.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jonathan R. Davis]], a prospector during the [[California Gold Rush]], was ambushed by eleven outlaws while together with two of his comrades. One of his friends was killed and the other was mortally wounded during the ambush. Davis drew both of his revolvers and fired, killing seven of the bandits, and killing the rest of them with his bowie knife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcs-group.com/oldwest/pistoleer/davis.html The Spell of the West: Captain Jonathan R.

==Modern times==
[[File:Alison Carroll 20080927 Festival du jeu video 02.jpg|thumb|Model dressed as [[Lara Croft]] dual wielding pistols]]
Dual wielding two handguns was said to have been popularized by the passion of film and television.&lt;ref name=&quot;GunDigestGuide2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry Ahern|title=Gun Digest Buyer's Guide to Concealed-Carry Handguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulWbH-4xtd8C|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=5 October 2010|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|isbn=978-1-4402-1767-8|pages=135–137|chapter=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[MythBusters]]'', there is an episode in which they compared many firing stances, including having a gun in each hand and found that, compared to the two-handed single-gun stance as a benchmark, only the one-handed shoulder-level stance with a single gun was comparable in terms of accuracy and speed. The ability to look down the sights of the gun was given as the main reason for this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Wheel of Mythfortune |series=MythBusters |date=November 23, 2011 |network=[[Discovery Channel]] |season=2011 |number=177 |first1=Adam |first2=Jamie |last1=Savage |last2=Hyneman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an episode the following year, they compared holding two guns and firing simultaneously—rather than alternating left and right shots—with holding one gun in the two-handed stance, and found that the results were in favor of using two guns and firing simultaneously.&lt;ref name=MythBusters&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood gunslingers|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/hollywood-gunslingers.htm|publisher=Mythbusters - Discovery|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ariel Sharon ''' ({{Lang-he-n|אֲרִיאֵל שָׁרוֹן}}; {{IPA-he|aʁiˈ(ʔ)el ʃaˈʁon|IPA|He-Ariel Sharon.ogg}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Ariʼēl Sharōn}}'', also known by his [[diminutive]] Arik, {{Script/Hebrew|אָרִיק}}, born '''Ariel Scheinermann''', {{Script/Hebrew|אֲרִיאֵל שַׁיינֶרְמָן}}; 26 February 1928 – 11 January 2014) was an Israeli general and politician who served as the 11th [[Prime Minister of Israel]] from March 2001 until April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lis |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.546747 |title=Ariel Sharon, former Israeli prime minister, dies at 85 |newspaper=Haaretz |agency=National Israel News |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=11 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111174341/http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.546747 |archivedate=11 January 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon was a commander in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Army]] from its creation in 1948. As a soldier and then an officer, he participated prominently in the [[1948 Palestine war]], becoming a platoon commander in the [[Alexandroni Brigade]] and taking part in many battles, including [[Battles of Latrun#Operation Bin Nun Alef (24–25 May)|Operation Bin Nun Alef]]. He was an instrumental figure in the creation of [[Unit 101]] and the [[reprisal operations]], as well as in the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, the [[War of Attrition]], and the [[Yom Kippur War|Yom-Kippur War]] of 1973. [[Yitzhak Rabin]] has called Sharon &quot;the greatest field commander in our history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israel page 19-24&quot;&gt;&quot;Israel's Man of War&quot;, Michael Kramer, ''New York'', pages 19–24, 9 August 1982: &quot;the &quot;greatest field commander in our history,&quot; says Yitzak Rabin&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon retirement from the military, Sharon entered politics, joining the [[Likud]] party, and served in a number of ministerial posts in Likud-led governments in 1977–92 and 1996–99. As Minister of Defense, he directed the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. An [[Kahan Commission|official enquiry]] found that he bore &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] and recommended that he be removed as Defense Minister. His role in the massacre led to him being known as the &quot;Butcher of Beirut&quot; among Arabs.&lt;ref name=butcher /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=MacFarquhar | first=Neil | title=To Arabs in the Street, Sharon's a Butcher; Some Others Show a Kind of Respect | newspaper=The New York Times | date=6 January 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/06/world/middleeast/to-arabs-in-the-street-sharons-a-butcher-some-others-show.html | access-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s through to the 1990s, Sharon championed construction of [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. He became the leader of the Likud in 2000, and served as Israel's prime minister from 2001 to 2006. However, as Prime Minister, in 2004–05 Sharon orchestrated [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 2693 People of Israel אריק שרון ואביו.JPG|thumb|left|Ariel Sharon at age 14 (second from right)]]
Sharon was born on 26 February 1928 in [[Kfar Malal]], an agricultural [[moshav]], then in [[Mandatory Palestine]], to Shmuel Scheinerman (1896–1956) of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]] and Vera (née Schneirov) Scheinerman (1900–1988) of [[Mogilev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/world/middleeast/ariel-sharon-fierce-defender-of-a-strong-israel-dies-at-85.html |author=Ethan Bronner |title=Ariel Sharon, Israeli Hawk Who Sought Peace on His Terms, Dies at 85 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=11 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111131821/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/world/middleeast/ariel-sharon-fierce-defender-of-a-strong-israel-dies-at-85.html |archivedate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Vera, was from a family of [[Russia]]n [[subbotniks|Subbotnik Jewish]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=11 March 2014|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4497612,00.html|title=Subbotnik Jews to resume aliyah|author=Itamar Eichner|publisher=Israel Jewish Scene|accessdate=9 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409152315/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4497612,00.html|url-status=live|archivedate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents met while at university in Tiflis (now [[Tbilisi]], Republic of Georgia), where Sharon's father was studying [[agronomy]] and his mother was studying medicine.

Sharon spoke both Hebrew and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isrageo.com/2014/09/17/sharonbelarys ШАРОН ВЕРНУЛСЯ В БЕЛАРУСЬ] 17 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years after their arrival at Kfar Malal, the Sheinermans had a daughter, Yehudit (Dita). Ariel was born two years later. At age 10, he joined the youth movement [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed]]. As a teenager, he began to take part in the armed night-patrols of his [[moshav]]. In 1942 at the age of 14, Sharon joined the [[Gadna (Israel)|Gadna]], a paramilitary youth [[battalion]], and later the [[Haganah]], the underground paramilitary force and the Jewish military precursor to the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF).&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt;

==Military career==

===Battle for Jerusalem and 1948 War===
[[File:Latroun (24 mai).png|200px|thumb|left|Operation Bin Nun (24–25 May 1948), during which Sharon was shot in the stomach, foot and groin.]]
Sharon's unit of the [[Haganah]] became engaged in serious and continuous combat from the autumn of 1947, with the onset of the [[Battle for Jerusalem (1948)|Battle for Jerusalem]]. Without the manpower to hold the roads, his unit took to making offensive hit-and-run raids on Arab forces in the vicinity of Kfar Malal. In units of thirty men, they would hit constantly at Arab villages, bridges and bases, as well as ambush the traffic between Arab villages and bases.

Sharon wrote in his autobiography: &quot;We had become skilled at finding our way in the darkest nights and gradually we built up the strength and endurance these kind of operations required. Under the stress of constant combat we drew closer to one another and began to operate not just as a military unit but almost as a family. ... [W]e were in combat almost every day. Ambushes and battles followed each other until they all seemed to run together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Sharon, with David Chanoff; ''Warrior: The Autobiography of Ariel Sharon'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001, pp 41, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his role in a night-raid on Iraqi forces at Bir Adas, Sharon was made a [[platoon]] commander in the [[Alexandroni Brigade]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; Following the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] and the onset of the [[1948 Arab Israeli War|War of Independence]], his platoon fended off the Iraqi advance at Kalkiya. Sharon was regarded as a hardened and aggressive soldier, swiftly moving up the ranks during the war. He was shot in the groin, stomach and foot by the Jordanian [[Arab Legion]] in the [[Battles of Latrun|First Battle of Latrun]], an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the besieged Jewish community of [[Jerusalem]]. Sharon wrote of the casualties in the &quot;horrible battle,&quot; and his brigade suffered 139 deaths.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Jordanian field marshal [[Habis Al-Majali]] claimed that Sharon was among 6 Israeli soldiers captured by the Jordanian 4th battalion during the battle, and that Habis took them to a camp in [[Mafraq]] and the 6 were later traded back.&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=الصهيونية: الغرب والمقدس والسياسة|author=الكريم, حسني، عبد|date=2010|publisher=شمس للنشر والتوزيع،|isbn=9789774930287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49lFAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon denied the claims, but Habes was adamant. &quot;Sharon is like a grizzly bear,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;I captured him, I healed his wounds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/27/guardianobituaries|work=The Guardian|title=Obituary: Habes al-Majali &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Guardian|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 and during the peace treaty signing ceremony with Jordan, Sharon wanted to get in touch with his former captor, but the latter determinedly refused to discuss the incident publicly.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1329691/Field-Marshal-Habis-al-Majali.html|newspaper=telegraph.co.uk|title=Field Marshal Habis al-Majali – Telegraph|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After recovering from the wounds received at Latrun, he resumed command of his patrol unit. On 28 December 1948, his platoon attempted to break through an Egyptian stronghold in Iraq-El-Manshia.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} At about this time, Israeli founding father [[David Ben-Gurion]] gave him the [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraized]] name &quot;Sharon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Freedland, Jonathan (3 January 2014). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/03/ariel-sharon-final-mission-peace-israel &quot;Ariel Sharon's final mission might well have been peace&quot;], ''The Guardian''. (&quot;Even his name was given to him by Israel's founding father, David Ben-Gurion – turning the young Scheinerman into Sharon as if he were King Arthur anointing a knight&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1949, Sharon was promoted to [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander (of the [[Golani Brigade]]'s reconnaissance unit) and in 1950 to [[Espionage|intelligence officer]] for Central Command. He then took leave to begin studies in history and Middle Eastern culture at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Sharon's subsequent military career would be characterized by insubordination, aggression and disobedience, but also brilliance as a commander.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Israel'', by Colin Shindler, Cambridge University Press, 31 March 2013, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unit 101===
A year and a half later, on the direct orders of the Prime Minister, Sharon returned to active service in the rank of major, as the founder and commander of the new [[Unit 101]], a special forces unit tasked with [[reprisal operations]] in response to [[Palestinian fedayeen]] attacks. The first Israeli commando unit, Unit 101 specialized in offensive guerrilla warfare in enemy countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; The unit consisted of 50 men, mostly former paratroopers and Unit 30 personnel. They were armed with non-standard weapons and tasked with carrying out special reprisals across the state's borders— mainly establishing small unit maneuvers, activation and insertion tactics. Training included engaging enemy forces across Israel's borders.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{cite book|title=Israel's Border Wars, 1949–1956: Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War|author=Benny Morris|year=1993|pages=251–253|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-829262-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli historian [[Benny Morris]] describes Unit 101:

{{Quote | style=font-size:100% | text=The new recruits began a harsh regimen of day and night training, their orientation and navigation exercises often taking them across the border; encounters with enemy patrols or village watchmen were regarded as the best preparation for the missions that lay ahead.

Unit 101 undertook a series of raids against [[Jordan]], which then held the [[West Bank]]. The raids also helped bolster Israeli morale and convince Arab states that the fledgling nation was capable of long-range military action. Known for raids against Arab civilians and military targets, the unit is held responsible for the widely condemned [[Qibya massacre]] in the fall of 1953. After a group of Palestinians used Qibya as a staging point for a fedayeen attack in [[Yehud-Monosson|Yehud]] that killed a Jewish woman and her two children in Israel, Unit 101 retaliated on the village.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; By various accounts of the ensuing attack, 65 to 70 Palestinian civilians, half of them women and children, were killed when Sharon's troops dynamited 45 houses and a school.&lt;ref name=&quot;SF Chronicle obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Stannard, Matthew B. |title=Ariel Sharon, former Israel PM, dies at 85 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ariel-Sharon-former-Israel-PM-dies-at-85-5134081.php |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112151320/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ariel-Sharon-former-Israel-PM-dies-at-85-5134081.php |archivedate=12 January 2014 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT op-ed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Bergman, Ronen |title=Ariel Sharon, the Ruthless Warrior Who Could Have Made Peace |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/opinion/ariel-sharon-the-warrior-who-could-have-made-peace.html |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111201758/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/opinion/ariel-sharon-the-warrior-who-could-have-made-peace.html |archivedate=11 January 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Silver, Eric |title=Ariel Sharon dies: Obituary – Unlike his right-wing predecessors, former Israeli PM was 'a pragmatist who could make concessions without feeling that he was committing sacrilege' |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=11 January 2014 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ariel-sharon-dies-obituary--unlike-his-rightwing-predecessors-former-israeli-pm-was-a-pragmatist-who-could-make-concessions-without-feeling-that-he-was-committing-sacrilege-9034506.html |accessdate=13 January 2014 |url-status=live |archivedate=12 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112162851/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ariel-sharon-dies-obituary--unlike-his-rightwing-predecessors-former-israeli-pm-was-a-pragmatist-who-could-make-concessions-without-feeling-that-he-was-committing-sacrilege-9034506.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing international condemnation for the attack, Ben-Gurion denied that the Israeli military was involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; In his memoir, Sharon wrote that the unit had checked all the houses before detonating the explosives and that he thought the houses were empty.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT op-ed&quot;/&gt; Although he admitted the results were tragic, Sharon defended the attack, however: &quot;Now people could feel that the terrorist gangs would think twice before striking, now that they knew for sure they would be hit back. Kibbya also put the Jordanian and Egyptian governments on notice that if Israel was vulnerable, so were they.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SF Chronicle obit&quot;/&gt;

A few months after its founding, Unit 101 was merged with the 890 Paratroopers Battalion to create the [[Paratroopers Brigade (IDF)|Paratroopers Brigade]], of which Sharon would also later become commander. Like Unit 101, it continued raids into Arab territory, culminating with the attack on the [[Qalqilyah]] police station in the autumn of 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israeli Special Forces History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |title=Israeli Special Forces History |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/special.html |accessdate=4 September 2009 |archivedate=10 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010141553/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_%26_Culture/special.html |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit 101 |type=History |url=http://en.specwar.info/special-forces/israel/unit-101/ |publisher=Specwar |accessdate=6 September 2009 |archivedate=13 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713055034/http://en.specwar.info/special-forces/israel/unit-101/ |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to the Suez War, the missions Sharon took part in included:{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
*'''[[Qibya massacre|Operation Shoshana]]''' (now known as the Qibya massacre)
*'''[[Operation Black Arrow]]'''

*'''[[Operation Volcano (Israeli raid)|Operation Volcano]]'''
*'''Operation Gulliver (מבצע גוליבר)'''
*'''Operation Lulav (מבצע לולב)'''

During a payback operation in the Deir al-Balah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Sharon was again wounded by gunfire, this time in the leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; Incidents such as those involving [[Meir Har-Zion]], along with many others, contributed to the tension between Prime Minister [[Moshe Sharett]], who often opposed Sharon's raids, and [[Moshe Dayan]], who had become increasingly ambivalent in his feelings towards Sharon. Later in the year, Sharon was investigated and tried by the Military Police for disciplining one of his subordinates. However, the charges were dismissed before the onset of the Suez War.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===1956 Suez War===
[[File:Davidi sharon.jpeg|thumb|left|165px|Sharon (left), armed with [[Ka-Bar|Ka-Bar combat knife]], stands with other paratroop commandos, before [[Operation Olive Leaves]], 1955.]]
Sharon commanded Unit 202 (the Paratroopers Brigade) during the [[Suez Crisis|1956 Suez War]] (the British &quot;[[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Operation Musketeer]]&quot;), leading the troop to take the ground east of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]'s [[Mitla Pass]] and eventually the pass itself against the advice of superiors, suffering heavy Israeli casualties in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;globes 1.11.14&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000908506 |title=Ariel Sharon dies |newspaper=Globes |date=14 January 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2014 |url-status=live |archivedate=15 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115085638/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000908506  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having successfully carried out the first part of his mission (joining a battalion parachuted near Mitla with the rest of the brigade moving on ground), Sharon's unit was deployed near the pass. Neither [[surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]] nor [[Reconnaissance|scouts]] reported enemy forces inside the Mitla Pass. Sharon, whose forces were initially heading east, away from the pass, reported to his superiors that he was increasingly concerned with the possibility of an enemy thrust through the pass, which could attack his brigade from the flank or the rear.
[[Image:1956 Suez war - conquest of Sinai.jpg|thumb|150px|1956 Israeli conquest of Sinai]]
Sharon asked for permission to attack the pass several times, but his requests were denied, though he was allowed to check its status so that if the pass was empty, he could receive permission to take it later. Sharon sent a small scout force, which was met with heavy fire and became bogged down due to vehicle malfunction in the middle of the pass. Sharon ordered the rest of his troops to attack in order to aid their comrades. Sharon was criticized by his superiors and was damaged by allegations several years later made by several former subordinates, who claimed that Sharon tried to provoke the [[Egyptians]] and sent out the scouts in bad faith, ensuring that a battle would ensue.

Sharon had assaulted Themed in a dawn attack, and had stormed the town with his armor through the Themed Gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varble|first=Derek|title=''The Suez Crisis 1956''|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing|Osprey]]|place=[[London]]|year=2003|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon routed the Sudanese police company, and captured the settlement. On his way to the [[An-Nakhl Fortress|Nakla]], Sharon's men came under attack from Egyptian MIG-15s. On the 30th, Sharon linked up with Eytan near Nakla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varble Derek&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Varble|first=Derek|title=''The Suez Crisis 1956''|publisher=Osprey|place=London |year=2003|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dayan had no more plans for further advances beyond the passes, but Sharon nonetheless decided to attack the Egyptian positions at Jebel Heitan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varble Derek&quot;/&gt; Sharon sent his lightly armed paratroopers against dug-in Egyptians supported by aircraft, tanks and heavy artillery. Sharon's actions were in response to reports of the arrival of the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the 4th Egyptian Armored Division in the area, which Sharon believed would annihilate his forces if he did not seize the high ground. Sharon sent two infantry companies, a mortar battery and some AMX-13 tanks under the command of [[Mordechai Gur]] into the Heitan Defile on the afternoon of 31 October 1956. The Egyptian forces occupied strong defensive positions and brought down heavy anti-tank, mortar and machine gun fire on the IDF force.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Varble|first=Derek|title=''The Suez Crisis 1956''|publisher=Osprey|place=London|year=2003|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gur's men were forced to retreat into the &quot;Saucer&quot;, where they were surrounded and came under heavy fire. Hearing of this, Sharon sent in another task force while Gur's men used the cover of night to scale the walls of the Heitan Defile. During the ensuing action, the Egyptians were defeated and forced to retreat. A total of 260 Egyptian and 38 Israeli soldiers were killed during the battle at Mitla. Due to these deaths, Sharon's actions at Mitla were surrounded in controversy, with many within the IDF viewing the deaths as the result of unnecessary and unauthorized aggression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varble Derek&quot;/&gt;

In the meantime, he occupied the position of an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] commander and received a [[law degree]] from [[Tel Aviv University]]. However, when [[Yitzhak Rabin]] became [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]] in 1964, Sharon again began to rise rapidly in the ranks, occupying the positions of Infantry School Commander and Head of Army Training Branch, eventually achieving the rank of [[Aluf]] ([[Major General]]).

In the [[Six-Day War]], Sharon, in command of an [[armored division]] on the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] [[Front (military)|front]], drew up his own complex offensive strategy that combined infantry troops, tanks and paratroopers from planes and helicopters to destroy the Egyptian forces Sharon's [[319th Division|38th Division]] faced when it broke through to the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; Sharon's victories and offensive strategy in the [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|Battle of Abu-Ageila]] led to international commendation by military strategists; he was judged to have inaugurated a new paradigm in operational command. Researchers at the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] studied Sharon's operational planning, concluding that it involved a number of unique innovations. It was a simultaneous attack by a multiplicity of small forces, each with a specific aim, attacking a particular unit in a synergistic Egyptian defense network. As a result, instead of supporting and covering each other as they were designed to do, each Egyptian unit was left fighting for its own life.&lt;ref&gt;''Hollow Land: Israel's Architecture of Occupation'', by Eyal Weizman, Verso 2012, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sapir Handelman, after Sharon's [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|assault of the Sinai in the Six-Day War]] and his [[Yom Kippur War#Israeli breakthrough|encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army in the Yom Kippur War]], the Israeli public nicknamed him &quot;The King of Israel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Conflict and Peacemaking in Israel-Palestine: Theory and Application'', By Sapir Handelman, (Routledge 2011), page 58: &quot;for the majority of Israelis, Sharon became once more the &quot;King of Israel&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon played a key role in the [[War of Attrition]]. In 1969, he was appointed the Head of IDF's [[Southern Command (Israel)|Southern Command]]. As leader of the southern command, on 29 July Israeli frogmen [[Operation Bulmus 6|stormed and destroyed Green Island]], a fortress at the northern end of the Gulf of Suez whose radar and antiaircraft installations controlled that sector's airspace. On 9 September Sharon's forces carried out [[Operation Raviv]], a large-scale raid along the western shore of the Gulf of Suez. Landing craft ferried across Russian-made tanks and armored personnel carriers that Israel had captured in 1967, and the small column harried the Egyptians for ten hours.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Sharon, ''Warrior'', Siomon &amp; Shuster 1989, page 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his appointment to the southern command, Sharon had no further promotions, and considered retiring. Sharon discussed the issue with Rabbi [[Menachem M. Schneerson]], who strongly advised him to remain at his post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/2458367/|title=The Rebbe to Sharon: Dont Leave the IDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon remained in the military for another three years, before retiring in August 1973. Soon after, he helped found the [[Likud]] (&quot;Unity&quot;) political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=17 June 2004 |accessdate=15 April 2006 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/storyville/ariel-sharon.shtml |title=Israel's generals: Ariel Sharon |publisher=[[BBC Four]] |location=UK |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525150251/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/storyville/ariel-sharon.shtml |archivedate=25 May 2006 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]] on 6 October 1973, Sharon was called back to active duty along with his assigned reserve armored division. On his farm, before he left for the front line, the Reserve Commander, Zeev Amit, said to him, &quot;How are we going to get out of this?&quot; Sharon replied, &quot;You don't know? We will cross the Suez Canal and the war will end over there.&quot; Sharon arrived at the front, to participate in his fourth war, in a civilian car.&lt;ref&gt;''Ariel Sharon'' by {{Interlanguage link|Uri Dan|de}}&lt;/ref&gt; His forces did not engage the [[Egyptian Army]] immediately, despite his requests. Under cover of darkness, Sharon's forces moved to a point on the [[Suez Canal]] that had been prepared before the war. In a move that again thwarted the commands of his superiors, Sharon's division crossed the Suez, effectively winning the war for Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; He then headed north [[Battle of Ismailia|towards Ismailia]], intent on cutting the Egyptian second army's supply lines, but his division was halted south of the [[Fresh Water Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/download/csipubs/gawrych/gawrych_pt6.pdf |title=The Alabatross of Decisive Victory: The 1973 Arab-Israeli War |author= Dr. George W.

[[File:Israeli Tanks Cross the Suez Canal - Flickr - Israel Defense Forces.jpg|thumb|150px|Sharon's 143rd Division, crossing the Suez Canal, in the direction of Cairo, 15 October 1973]]

[[Abraham Adan]]'s division passed over the bridgehead into Africa, advancing to within 101 kilometers of [[Cairo]]. His division managed to encircle [[Suez]], cutting off and [[Encirclement|encircling]] the Third Army. Tensions between the two generals followed Sharon's decision, but a [[military tribunal]] later found his action was militarily effective.

Sharon's complex ground maneuver is regarded as a decisive move in the Yom Kippur War, undermining the [[Egyptian Second Army]] and encircling the Egyptian Third Army.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yom Kippur War 1973 (2): The Sinai'', By Simon Dunstan, Osprey Publishing, 20 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This move was regarded by many Israelis as the turning point of the war in the Sinai front. Thus, Sharon is widely viewed as the hero of the Yom Kippur War, responsible for Israel's ground victory in the Sinai in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; A photo of Sharon wearing a head bandage on the Suez Canal became a famous symbol of Israeli military prowess.

Sharon's political positions were controversial, and he was relieved of duty in February 1974.

===Bar Lev Line===
{{Main|Bar Lev Line}}
Following Israel's victory in the six-day war, the war of attrition at the [[Suez Canal]] began. The Egyptians began firing in provocation against the Israeli forces posted on the eastern part of the canal. [[Haim Bar Lev]], Israel's chief of staff, suggested that Israel construct a border line to protect its southern border. A wall of sand and earth raised along almost the entire length of the Suez Canal would both allow observation of Egyptian forces and conceal the movements of Israeli troops on the eastern side. This line, named after the chief of staff Haim Bar Lev, became known as the [[Bar Lev Line]]. It included at least thirty strong points stretching over almost 200 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;Ahron Bregman, ''Israel's Wars: A History Since 1947''. Routledge, 2000. Page 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Bar Lev suggested that such a line would defend against any major Egyptian assault across the canal, and was expected to function as a &quot;graveyard for Egyptian troops&quot;. [[Moshe Dayan]] described it as &quot;one of the best anti-tank ditches in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. George W. Gawrych, [http://cgsc.leavenworth.army.mil/carl/download/csipubs/gawrych/gawrych_pt1.pdf The 1973 Arab-Israeli War: The Albatross of Decisive Victory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507130100/http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/download/csipubs/gawrych/gawrych_pt1.pdf |date=7 May 2011 }} p.16-18&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon, and [[Israel Tal]] on the other hand, vigorously opposed the line. Sharon said that it would pin down large military formations that would be sitting ducks for deadly artillery attacks, and cited the opinion of Rabbi [[Menachem M. Schneerson]], who explained him &quot;the great military disaster such a line could bring.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin, ''[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History]]''. HarperCollins, 2014. Pages 289–290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Sharon, ''Warrior''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1989. Page 236&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, it was completed in spring 1970.

During the [[Yom Kippur War]], Egyptian forces successfully breached the Bar Lev Line in less than two hours at a cost of more than a thousand dead and some 5,000 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Harel, {{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/from-the-bar-lev-line-to-sharon-s-1.51760 |title=From the Bar-Lev Line to Sharon's |work=Haaretz |date=28 February 2002 |archivedate=20 November 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120130938/http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/from-the-bar-lev-line-to-sharon-s-1.51760  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon would later recall that what [[Menachem M.

==Early political career, 1974–2001==

===Beginnings of political career===
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2014}}
In the 1940s and 1950s, Sharon seemed to be personally devoted to the ideals of [[Mapai]], the predecessor of the modern [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]]. However, after retiring from military service, he joined the Liberal Party and was instrumental in establishing [[Likud]] in July 1973 by a merger of [[Herut]], the [[Liberalism in Israel|Liberal Party]] and independent elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent obit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Sharon-The-life-of-a-lion-337867 |title=Sharon: The life of a lion |author=Tovah Lazaroff |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=12 January 2014 |accessdate=5 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209114040/http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Sharon-The-life-of-a-lion-337867 |archivedate=9 December 2014 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon became chairman of the campaign staff for [[1973 Israeli legislative election|that year's elections]], which were scheduled for November. Two and a half weeks after the start of the election campaign, the [[Yom Kippur War]] erupted and Sharon was called back to reserve service. On the heels of being hailed as a war hero for crossing the Suez in the 1973 war, Sharon won a seat to the Knesset in the elections that year,&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; but resigned a year later.

From June 1975 to March 1976, Sharon was a special aide to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]]. He planned his return to politics for the [[1977 Israeli legislative election|1977 elections]]; first, he tried to return to the Likud and replace [[Menachem Begin]] at the head of the party. He suggested to [[Simha Erlich]], who headed the Liberal Party bloc in the Likud, that he was more able than Begin to win an election victory; he was rejected, however. He then tried to join the Labor Party and the [[centrism|centrist]] [[Democratic Movement for Change]], but was rejected by those parties too. Only then did he form his own list, [[Shlomtzion (political party)|Shlomtzion]], which won two Knesset seats in the subsequent elections. Immediately after the elections, he merged Shlomtzion with the Likud and became [[Agriculture Minister of Israel|Minister of Agriculture]].

When Sharon joined Begin's government, he had relatively little political experience. During this period, Sharon supported the [[Gush Emunim]] settlements movement and was viewed as the patron of the settlers' movement. He used his position to encourage the establishment of a network of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories to prevent the possibility of [[Palestinian Arab]]s' return to these territories. Sharon doubled the number of Jewish settlements on the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] during his tenure.

After the 1981 elections, Begin rewarded Sharon for his important contribution to Likud's narrow win, by appointing him [[Defense Minister of Israel|Minister of Defense]].

Under Sharon, Israel continued to build upon the unprecedented coordination between the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and the [[South African Defence Force]], with Israeli and South African generals giving each other unfettered access to each other's battlefields and military tactics, and Israel sharing with South Africa highly classified information about its missions, such as [[Operation Opera]], which had previously only been reserved for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship with Apartheid South Africa |first=Sasha |last=Polakow-Suransky |publisher=Random House |year=2010 |pages=145–147 |isbn=978-1770098404}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, after visiting South African forces fighting in Namibia for 10 days, Sharon argued that South Africa needed more weapons to fight Soviet infiltration in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00714FF3E5C0C778DDDAB0994D9484D81

An [[Associated Press]] report on 15 September 1982 stated, &quot;Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, in a statement, tied the killing of the Phalangist leader [[Bachir Gemayel]] to the PLO, saying 'it symbolises the terrorist murderousness of the PLO terrorist organisations and their supporters'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Robert Fisk]]|title=[[The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East]] |publisher= Fourth Estate|location=London|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Habib Chartouni]], a Lebanese Christian from the [[Syrian Socialist National Party]] confessed to the murder of Gemayel, and no Palestinians were involved.

Robert Maroun Hatem, Hobeika's bodyguard, stated in his book ''From Israel to Damascus'' that Phalangist commander [[Elie Hobeika]] ordered the massacre of civilians in defiance of Israeli instructions to behave like a &quot;dignified&quot; army.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Maroun Hatem, ''From Israel to Damascus'', Chapter 7: &quot;The Massacres at Sabra and Shatilla&quot; [https://web.archive.org/web/20030330062741/http://www.free-lebanon.com/News/Documents_of_Note/DOC_chap8/doc_chap8.html online]    {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040512001055/http://www.free-lebanon.com/News/Documents_of_Note/DOC_chap8/doc_chap8.html |date=12 May 2004 }}. Retrieved 24 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Hatem claimed &quot;Sharon had given strict orders to Hobeika....to guard against any desperate move&quot; and that Hobeika perpetrated the massacre &quot;to tarnish Israel's reputation worldwide&quot; for the benefit of Syria. Hobeika subsequently joined the Syrian occupation government and lived as a prosperous businessman under Syrian protection; further massacres in Sabra and Shatilla occurred with Syrian support in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Edward|last2=Bogdanor|first2=Paul|title=The Jewish Divide Over Israel|publisher=Transaction|year=2006|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massacre followed intense Israeli bombings of [[Beirut]] that had seen heavy civilian casualties, testing Israel's relationship with the United States in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT anziska&quot;/&gt; America sent troops to help negotiate the PLO's exit from Lebanon, withdrawing them after negotiating a ceasefire that ostensibly protected Palestinian civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT anziska&quot;/&gt;

====Legal findings====
After 400,000 [[Peace Now]] protesters rallied in [[Tel Aviv]] to demand an official government inquiry into the massacres, the official Israeli government investigation into the massacre at Sabra and Shatila, the [[Kahan Commission]] (1982), was conducted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; The inquiry found that the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Defense Forces]] were indirectly responsible for the massacre since IDF troops held the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT anziska&quot;/&gt; The commission determined that the killings were carried out by a Phalangist unit acting on its own, but its entry was known to Israel and approved by Sharon. Prime Minister Begin was also found responsible for not exercising greater involvement and awareness in the matter of introducing the Phalangists into the camps.

The commission also concluded that Sharon bore personal responsibility&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT anziska&quot;/&gt; &quot;for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge [and] not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed&quot;. It said Sharon's negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control, amounted to a dereliction of duty of the minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiff|first=Ze'ev|authorlink=Ze'ev Schiff|author2=[[Ehud Ya'ari]]|title=Israel's Lebanon War|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=1984|pages=[https://archive.org/details/israelslebanonwa0000schi/page/283 283–284]|isbn=0-671-47991-1|url=https://archive.org/details/israelslebanonwa0000schi/page/283}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1983, the commission recommended the removal of Sharon from his post as defense minister and stated:

&lt;blockquote style=font-size:100%&gt;We have found&amp;nbsp;... that the Minister of Defense [Ariel Sharon] bears personal responsibility. In our opinion, it is fitting that the Minister of Defense draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office— and if necessary, that the Prime Minister consider whether he should exercise his authority ...&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;... remove [him] from office.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date=8 February 1983|accessdate=15 April 2006|title=Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the events at the refugee camps in Beirut&amp;nbsp;— 8 February 1983|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/mfadocuments/yearbook6/pages/104%20report%20of%20the%20commission%20of%20inquiry%20into%20the%20e.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sharon initially refused to resign as defense minister, and Begin refused to fire him. After a grenade was thrown into a dispersing crowd at an Israeli [[Peace Now]] march, killing [[Emil Grunzweig]] and injuring 10 others, a compromise was reached: Sharon agreed to forfeit the post of defense minister but stayed in the cabinet as a [[minister without portfolio]].

Sharon's resignation as defense minister is listed as one of the important events of the [[Tenth Knesset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=1 September 2011 |title=Knesset 9-11 |publisher=Gov.il |url=http://www.gov.il/FirstGov/TopNavEng/EngSubjects/EngSElections/EngSEKnessets/EngSE9-11/ |archivedate=22 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922044840/http://www.gov.il/FirstGov/TopNavEng/EngSubjects/EngSElections/EngSEKnessets/EngSE9-11/ |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 21 February 1983 issue, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' published an article implying that Sharon was directly responsible for the massacres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith |first=William E. |others=Reported by Harry Kelly and Robert Slater |title=The Verdict Is Guilty: An Israeli commission and the Beirut massacre |url=http://content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,925886,00.html |accessdate=28 September 2010 |journal=Time |volume=121 |issue=8 |date=21 February 1983 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140423030943/http://content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,925886,00.html |archivedate=23 April 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon sued ''Time'' for [[Slander and libel|libel]] in American and Israeli courts. Although the jury concluded that the ''Time'' article included false allegations, they found that the magazine had not acted with [[actual malice]] and so was not guilty of libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://brookekroeger.com/articles_newspaper/Sharonloses.html |author=Brooke W.

On 18 June 2001, relatives of the victims of the Sabra massacre began proceedings in Belgium to have Sharon indicted on alleged [[war crime]]s charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complaint Against Ariel Sharon for his involvement in the massacres at Sabra and Shatila |url=http://www.caabu.org/campaigns/complaint-against-sharon.html |accessdate=15 April 2006 |publisher=[[The Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding]] |archivedate=4 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404060442/http://www.caabu.org/campaigns/complaint-against-sharon.html |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elie Hobeika, the leader of the Phalange militia who carried out the massacres, was assassinated in January 2002, several months before he was scheduled to testify trial.

After his dismissal from the Defense Ministry post, Sharon remained in successive governments as a minister without portfolio (1983–1984), [[Industry, Trade and Labour Minister of Israel|Minister for Trade and Industry]] (1984–1990), and [[Housing and Construction Minister of Israel|Minister of Housing Construction]] (1990–1992). In the Knesset, he was member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense committee (1990–1992) and Chairman of the committee overseeing [[aliyah|Jewish immigration]] from the [[Soviet Union]]. During this period he was a rival to then prime minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]], but failed in various bids to replace him as chairman of Likud. Their rivalry reached a head in February 1990, when Sharon grabbed the microphone from Shamir, who was addressing the Likud central committee, and famously exclaimed: &quot;Who's for wiping out terrorism?&quot;&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharon Quits Cabinet in Likud Scrap |url=http://articles.philly.com/1990-02-13/news/25883895_1_likud-party-likud-meeting-sharon-and-shamir |accessdate=11 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |date=13 February 1990 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111174335/http://articles.philly.com/1990-02-13/news/25883895_1_likud-party-likud-meeting-sharon-and-shamir |archivedate=11 January 2014 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was widely viewed as an apparent [[Coup d'état|coup]] attempt against Shamir's leadership of the party.

In [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s 1996–1999 government, Sharon was [[National Infrastructure Minister of Israel|Minister of National Infrastructure]] (1996–98), and [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Foreign Minister]] (1998–99). Upon the election of the [[Ehud Barak|Barak]] Labor government, Sharon became leader of the Likud party.

==== Opposition to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia ====
Ariel Sharon criticised the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] in 1999 as an act of &quot;brutal interventionism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/ariel-sharon-by-robert-fisk-521809.html Ariel Sharon... by Robert Fisk] Friday 6 January 2006, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon said both Serbia and Kosovo have been victims of violence. He said prior to the current Yugoslav campaign against Kosovo Albanians, Serbians were the targets of attacks in the Kosovo province. &quot;Israel has a clear policy. We are against aggressive actions. We are against hurting innocent people. I hope that the sides will return to the negotiating table as soon as possible.&quot; During the crisis, Elyakim Haetzni said the Serbs should be the first to receive Israeli aid. &quot;There are our traditional friends,&quot; he told Israel Radio.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Israel government refrains from supporting NATO attacks'', By Steve Rodan, Tuesday, 30 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that Sharon may have supported the Yugoslav position because of the Serbian population's history of saving Jews during the holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.585494 Russia or Ukraine? For some Israelis, Holocaust memories are key] Haaretz, By David Landau, 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On Sharon's death, Serbian minister [[Aleksandar Vulin]] stated: The Serbian people will remember Sharon for opposing the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against the former Yugoslavia and advocating respect for sovereignty of other nations and a policy of not interfering with their internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serbia-times.com/aleksandar-vulin-lays-wreath-at-ariel-sharons-grave Aleksandar Vulin lays wreath at Ariel Sharon’s grave] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521100600/http://www.serbia-times.com/aleksandar-vulin-lays-wreath-at-ariel-sharons-grave/ |date=21 May 2014 }} Published on 20 January 2014, Serbia Times&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign for Prime Minister, 2000–2001===
On 28 September 2000, Sharon and an escort of over 1,000 Israeli police officers visited the [[Temple Mount]] complex, site of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]], the holiest place in the world to Jews and the third holiest site in Islam. Sharon declared that the complex would remain under perpetual Israeli control. Palestinian commentators accused Sharon of purposely inflaming emotions with the event to provoke a violent response and obstruct success of delicate ongoing peace talks. On the following day, a large number of Palestinian demonstrators and an Israeli police contingent confronted each other at the site. According to the [[U.S. State Department]], &quot;Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.&quot; According to the government of Israel, 14 policemen were injured.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Sharon's visit, a few months before his election as Prime Minister, came after archeologists claimed that extensive building operations at the site were destroying priceless antiquities. Sharon's supporters claim that [[Yasser Arafat]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]] planned the [[Second Intifada]] months prior to Sharon's visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Khaled Abu Toameh|date=19 September 2002|url= http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/111P55.htm|title=How the war began}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East Troubles |date=20 May 2001 |publisher=Townhall.com |author=Charles Krauthammer |url=http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/charleskrauthammer/2001/05/20/166454.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109052547/http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/charleskrauthammer/2001/05/20/166454.html |archivedate=9 November 2005 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Myths &amp; Facts Online: The Palestinian Uprisings |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf19.html#a1 |author=Mitchell G.

They also often quote statements by Palestinian Authority officials, particularly Imad Falouji, the P.A. Communications Minister, who admitted months after Sharon's visit that the violence had been planned in July, far in advance of Sharon's visit, stating the intifada &quot;was carefully planned since the return of (Palestinian President) Yasser Arafat from [[Camp David 2000 Summit|Camp David]] negotiations rejecting the U.S. conditions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jewishweek.org/news/newscontent.php3?artid=3846 |title=PA: Intifada Was Planned |author=Stewart Ain |date=20 December 2000 |newspaper=[[The Jewish Week]] |archivedate=10 March 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310043812/http://jewishweek.org/news/newscontent.php3?artid=3846 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Mitchell Report (Arab-Israeli conflict)|Mitchell Report]],
&lt;blockquote style=font-size:100%&gt;the government of Israel asserted that the immediate catalyst for the violence was the breakdown of the Camp David negotiations on 25 July 2000 and the &quot;widespread appreciation in the international community of Palestinian responsibility for the impasse.&quot; In this view, Palestinian violence was planned by the PA leadership, and was aimed at &quot;provoking and incurring Palestinian casualties as a means of regaining the diplomatic initiative.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Mitchell Report found that
&lt;blockquote style=font-size:100%&gt;the Sharon visit did not cause the Al-Aqsa Intifada. But it was poorly timed and the provocative effect should have been foreseen; indeed, it was foreseen by those who urged that the visit be prohibited. More significant were the events that followed: The decision of the Israeli police on 29 September to use lethal means against the Palestinian demonstrators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition, the report stated,
&lt;blockquote style=font-size:100%&gt;Accordingly, we have no basis on which to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the PA [Palestinian Authority] to initiate a campaign of violence at the first opportunity; or to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the GOI [Government of Israel] to respond with lethal force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/Mitchellrep.html |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |title=The Mitchell Report |date=4 May 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625000052/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/Mitchellrep.html |archivedate=25 June 2009 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Or Commission, an Israeli panel of inquiry appointed to investigate the October 2000 events,
&lt;blockquote style=font-size:100%&gt;criticised the Israeli police for being unprepared for the riots and possibly using excessive force to disperse the mobs, resulting in the deaths of 12 Arab Israeli, one Jewish and one Palestinian citizens.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the collapse of Barak's government, Sharon was [[2001 Israeli prime ministerial election|elected Prime Minister on 6 February 2001]], defeating Barak 62 percent to 38 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; Sharon's senior adviser was [[Raanan Gissin]].

A survey conducted by Tel Aviv University's Jaffe Center in May 2004 found that 80% of Jewish Israelis believed that the Israel Defense Forces had succeeded in militarily countering the Al-Aqsa Intifada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=May 2004  |url=http://spirit.tau.ac.il/socant/peace/peaceindex/2004/data/may2004d.pdf |script-title=he:מדד השלום |publisher=The Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research |language=he |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108082619/http://spirit.tau.ac.il/socant/peace/peaceindex/2004/data/may2004d.pdf |archivedate=8 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of the more pro-Russian Sharon, as well as the more pro-Israel [[Vladimir Putin]], led to an improvement in [[Israel–Russia relations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-maturing-of-israeli-russian-relations The Maturing of Israeli-Russian Relations] Anna Borshchevskaya, ''inFocus Quarterly'', Spring 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, Sharon became the first prime minister of Israel to visit [[India]], saying that Israel regarded India as one of the most important countries in the world. Some analysts speculated on the development of a three-way military axis of [[New Delhi]], [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3089466.stm |title=India and Israel vow to fight terrorism |work=BBC News |date=9 September 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727134615/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3089466.stm |archivedate=27 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2004, Sharon called on [[French Jews]] to emigrate from France to Israel immediately, in light of an increase in [[Antisemitism in 21st-century France|antisemitism in France]] (94 antisemitic assaults were reported in the first six months of 2004, compared to 47 in 2003). France has the third-largest Jewish population in the world (about 600,000 people). Sharon observed that an &quot;unfettered anti-Semitism&quot; reigned in France. The French government responded by describing his comments as &quot;unacceptable&quot;, as did the French representative Jewish organization [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], which denied Sharon's claim of intense anti-Semitism in French society. An Israeli spokesperson later claimed that Sharon had been misunderstood. France then postponed a visit by Sharon. Upon his visit, both Sharon and French President [[Jacques Chirac]] were described as showing a willingness to put the issue behind them.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Unilateral disengagement===
{{Main|Israel's unilateral disengagement plan}}
In September 2001, Sharon stated for the first time that Palestinians should have the right to establish their own land west of the [[Jordan River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ha'aretz obit&quot;/&gt; In May 2003, Sharon endorsed the [[Road Map for Peace]] put forth by the United States, the [[European Union]] and Russia, which opened a dialogue with [[Mahmud Abbas]], and stated his commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state in the future.

He embarked on a course of unilateral withdrawal from the [[Gaza Strip]], while maintaining control of its coastline and airspace. Sharon's plan was welcomed by both the [[Palestinian Authority]] and Israel's left wing as a step towards a final peace settlement. However, it was greeted with opposition from within his own Likud party and from other right wing Israelis, on national security, military, and religious grounds.

===Disengagement from Gaza===
On 1 December 2004, Sharon dismissed five ministers from the Shinui party for voting against the government's 2005 budget. In January 2005, Sharon formed a [[national unity government]] that included representatives of Likud, Labor, and [[Meimad]] and [[Degel HaTorah]] as &quot;out-of-government&quot; supporters without any seats in the government ([[United Torah Judaism]] parties usually reject having ministerial offices as a policy). Between 16 and 30 August 2005, Sharon controversially expelled 9,480 Jewish settlers from 21 settlements in Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank. Once it became clear that the evictions were definitely going ahead, a group of conservative Rabbis, led by [[Yosef Dayan]], placed an ancient curse on Sharon known as the [[Pulsa diNura]], calling on the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|Angel of Death]] to intervene and kill him. After Israeli soldiers bulldozed every settlement structure except for several former synagogues, Israeli soldiers formally left Gaza on 11 September 2005 and closed the border fence at [[Kissufim]]. While his decision to withdraw from Gaza sparked bitter protests from members of the Likud party and the settler movement, opinion polls showed that it was a popular move among most of the Israeli electorate, with more than 80 percent of Israelis backing the plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url-status=live |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/12/09/israel.government/index.html |title=Sharon party agrees coalition plan |agency=[[CNN]] |date=10 December 2004 |accessdate=6 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625000052/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/12/09/israel.government/index.html |archivedate=25 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 2005, Sharon narrowly defeated a leadership challenge by a 52–48 percent vote. The move was initiated within the central committee of the governing Likud party by Sharon's main rival, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], who had left the cabinet to protest Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza. The measure was an attempt by Netanyahu to call an early primary in November 2005 to choose the party's leader.

===Founding of Kadima===
On 21 November 2005, Sharon resigned as head of Likud, and dissolved parliament to form a new centrist party called [[Kadima]] (&quot;Forward&quot;). November polls indicated that Sharon was likely to be returned to the prime ministership. On 20 December 2005, Sharon's longtime rival Netanyahu was elected his successor as leader of Likud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharon recovers as chief rival wins control of Likud |date=20 December 2005 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/20/israel |first=Conal |last=Urquhart |accessdate=25 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829205312/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/20/israel |archivedate=29 August 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Sharon's incapacitation, Ehud Olmert replaced Sharon as Kadima's leader, for the nearing general elections. Likud, along with the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]], were ''Kadima''{{'}}s chief rivals in the [[2006 Israel legislative election|March 2006 elections]].

Sharon's stroke occurred a few months before he had been expected to win a new election and was widely interpreted as planning on &quot;clearing Israel out of most of the West Bank&quot;, in a series of unilateral withdrawals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofisrael.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Terrorism 2013, page 9&quot;/&gt;

In the elections, which saw Israel's lowest-ever voter turnout of 64 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idi.org.il/sites/english/parliament/Pages/ElectionsfortheLocalAuthority.aspx |title=Elections for the Local Authority&amp;nbsp;— Who, What, When, Where and How?&amp;nbsp;— The Israel Democracy Institute |publisher=Idi.org.il |accessdate=6 August 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727134615/http://www.idi.org.il/sites/english/parliament/Pages/ElectionsfortheLocalAuthority.aspx |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the number usually averages on the high 70%), Kadima, headed by Olmert, received the most Knesset seats, followed by Labor. The new governing coalition installed in May 2006 included Kadima, with Olmert as Prime Minister, Labor (including [[Amir Peretz]] as Defense Minister), the [[Pensioners' Party (Gil)]], the [[Shas]] religious party, and [[Israel Beytenu]].

===Alleged fundraising irregularities and Greek island affair===
During the latter part of his career, Sharon was investigated for alleged involvement in a number of financial scandals, in particular, the [[Greek Island Affair]] and irregularities of fundraising during the 1999 election campaign. In the Greek Island Affair, Sharon was accused of promising (during his term as Foreign Minister) to help Israeli businessman [[David Appel (businessman)|David Appel]] in his development project on a Greek island in exchange for large consultancy payments to Sharon's son Gilad. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. In the 1999 election fundraising scandal, Sharon was not charged with any wrongdoing, but his son [[Omri Sharon|Omri]], a Knesset member at the time, was charged and sentenced in 2006 to nine months in prison.

To avoid a potential conflict of interest in relation to these investigations, Sharon was not involved in the confirmation of the appointment of a new attorney general, [[Menahem Mazuz]], in 2005.

On 10 December 2005, Israeli police raided [[Martin Schlaff]]'s apartment in Jerusalem. Another suspect in the case was Robert Nowikovsky, an Austrian involved in Russian state-owned company [[Gazprom]]'s business activities in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP Schlaff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hF2cuPKuthlnLDUja9QFzqUv1CzQ |title=Austrian tycoon may face Israel charges: report |date=7 September 2010 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910110500/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hF2cuPKuthlnLDUja9QFzqUv1CzQ |archivedate=10 September 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/95989 |author=Hillel Fendel |title=Police Say There's Evidence Linking Sharon to $3&amp;nbsp;Million Bribe |work=[[Arutz Sheva]] |date=3 January 2006 |archivedate=19 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719082601/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/95989 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazoviki&gt;{{cite news|date=13 September 2007 |url=http://robertamsterdam.com/2007/09/the_gazoviki_in_germany/ |title=A tale of gazoviki, money and greed |publisher=[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]] |archivedate=16 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816065821/http://robertamsterdam.com/2007/09/the_gazoviki_in_germany/  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/04/content_4004864.htm |title=Police have evidence Sharon's family takes bribes: TV |agency=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] |date=4 January 2006 |archivedate=9 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609215018/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/04/content_4004864.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Haaretz'', &quot;The $3&amp;nbsp;million that parachuted into Gilad and Omri Sharon's bank account toward the end of 2002 was transferred there in the context of a consultancy contract for development of kolkhozes (collective farms) in Russia. Gilad Sharon was brought into the campaign to make the wilderness bloom in Russia by Getex, a large Russian-based exporter of seeds (peas, millet, wheat) from Eastern Europe. Getex also has ties with Israeli firms involved in exporting wheat from Ukraine, for example. The company owns farms in Eastern Europe and is considered large and prominent in its field. It has its Vienna offices in the same building as Jurimex, which was behind the $1-million guarantee to the [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/special-report-the-schlaff-saga/the-schlaff-saga-money-flows-into-the-sharon-family-accounts-1.312801 |title=The Schlaff Saga / Money flows into the Sharon family accounts |newspaper=Haaretz |date=7 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105001347/http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/special-report-the-schlaff-saga/the-schlaff-saga-money-flows-into-the-sharon-family-accounts-1.312801 |archivedate=5 November 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon suffered from [[obesity]] from the 1980s and also had suspected chronic [[high blood pressure]] and [[high cholesterol]] – at {{convert|170|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, he was reputed to weigh {{convert|115|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-12-26-sharon-procedure_x.htm |title=Ariel Sharon to undergo heart procedure |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |author=Jim Hollander |date=26 December 2005 |accessdate=16 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213194143/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-12-26-sharon-procedure_x.htm |url-status=live |archivedate=13 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories of Sharon's appetite and obesity were legendary in Israel.

Numerous attempts by doctors, friends, and staff to impose a balanced diet on Sharon were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ariel Sharon: A Life in Times of Turmoil |author= [[Freddy Eytan]] and Robert Davies |year= 2006 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon was hospitalized on 18 December 2005, after suffering a minor [[ischemic stroke]]. During his hospital stay, doctors discovered a heart defect requiring surgery and ordered bed rest pending a [[cardiac catheterization]] scheduled for 5 January 2006. Instead, Sharon immediately returned to work and suffered a [[hemorrhagic stroke]] on 4 January, the day before surgery. After two surgeries lasting 7 and 14 hours, doctors stopped the bleeding in Sharon's brain, but were unable to prevent him from entering into a coma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharon's stroke blood 'drained' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4608100.stm |archivedate=11 February 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211215947/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4608100.stm |date=5 January 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent media reports indicated that Sharon had been diagnosed with [[cerebral amyloid angiopathy]] (CAA) during his December hospitalisation. [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Hospital]] Director Shlomo Mor-Yosef declined to respond to comments that the combination of CAA and blood thinners after Sharon's December stroke might have caused his more serious subsequent stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Willacy |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/01/10/1545220.htm |title=Israeli PM Sharon moves left side |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=10 January 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013102120/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/01/10/1545220.htm |archivedate=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ehud Olmert]] became [[Deputy Prime Minister of Israel#Acting Prime Minister|Acting Prime Minister]] the night of Sharon's second stroke, while Sharon officially remained in office. [[2006 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]] followed in March, with Olmert and Sharon's [[Kadima]] party winning a plurality. The next month, the Israeli Cabinet declared Sharon permanently incapacitated and Olmert became Interim Prime Minister on 14 April 2006 and Prime Minister in his own right on 4 May.

Sharon underwent a series of subsequent surgeries related to his state. In May 2006, he was transferred to a long-term care facility in [[Sheba Medical Center]]. In July of that year, he was briefly taken to the hospital's intensive care unit to be treated for bacteria in his blood, before returning to the long-term care facility on 6 November 2006. Sharon would remain at Sheba Medical Center until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6120298.stm |title=Sharon leaves intensive care unit |work=BBC News |date=6 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116112304/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6120298.stm |archivedate=16 January 2007 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/26/sharon/|title=Hospital: Sharon taken to&amp;nbsp;intensive care – Jul 26, 2006|website=CNN|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/ariel-sharon-transferred-to-long-term-treatment-in-tel-hashomer-1.188810|title=Ariel Sharon Transferred to Long-term Treatment in Tel Hashomer|first=Haaretz|last=Service|date=28 May 2006|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical experts indicated that his [[cognition|cognitive]] abilities had likely been destroyed by the stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/world/asia/12-04-2006/79107-sharon-0/ |title=Ariel Sharon's sons to disconnect their father from life-support system |newspaper=Pravda |accessdate=6 August 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605054545/http://english.pravda.ru/world/asia/12-04-2006/79107-sharon-0/ |archivedate=5 June 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theage.com.au/world/sharon-will-never-recover-doctors-20100105-ls9c.html |location= [[Melbourne]] |work= [[The Age]] |title=Sharon will never recover: doctors |date= 6 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919025443/http://www.theage.com.au/world/sharon-will-never-recover-doctors-20100105-ls9c.html |archivedate= 19 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/ariel-sharon-transferred-to-long-term-treatment-in-tel-hashomer-1.188810 |title=Ariel Sharon transferred to long-term treatment in Tel HaShomer |date=28 May 2006 |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=28 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121204208/http://www.haaretz.com/news/ariel-sharon-transferred-to-long-term-treatment-in-tel-hashomer-1.188810 |archivedate=21 November 2010 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His condition worsened from late 2013, and Sharon suffered from [[renal failure]] on 1 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/ariel-sharons-condition-deteriorates |title=Ariel Sharon's Condition Deteriorates |newspaper=The Times of Israel |accessdate=1 January 2014 |archivedate=2 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102195820/http://www.timesofisrael.com/ariel-sharons-condition-deteriorates  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctors: End for Sharon Could Come 'Within Hours' |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/175830#.UsUXDPQW0V0 |accessdate=2 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Arutz Sheva]] |date=2 January 2014 |url-status=live |archivedate=2 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192658/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/175830  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Sharon was married twice, to two sisters, Margalit and Lily Zimmerman, who were from [[Romania]]. Sharon met Margalit in 1947 when she was 16, while she was tending a vegetable field, and married her in 1953, shortly after becoming a [[Drill instructor|military instructor]]. Margalit was a supervisory psychiatric nurse.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/politics/p/arielsharon.htm|publisher=marriage.about.com|title=Marriages of Ariel Sharon|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had one son, Gur. Margalit died in a car accident in May 1962 and Gur died in October 1967, aged 11, after a friend accidentally shot him while the two children were playing with a rifle at the Sharon family home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=15 February 2005 |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/Middle-East-Conflict/Sharon-mourns-slain-son/2005/02/14/1108229937965.html |title=Sharon mourns slain son |accessdate=15 April 2006 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |archivedate=6 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506044705/http://www.smh.com.au/news/Middle-East-Conflict/Sharon-mourns-slain-son/2005/02/14/1108229937965.html |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/07/israel1 |title=The Bulldozer |date=7 November 2001 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=15 April 2006 |first=Emma |last=Brockes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825214643/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/07/israel1 |archivedate=25 August 2013 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0306/14/pitn.00.html |title=The Quest for Peace |type=transcript |date=14 June 2003 |accessdate=28 March 2006 |archivedate=16 February 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216025138/http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0306/14/pitn.00.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Margalit's death, Sharon married her younger sister, Lily.

Sharon's sister, Yehudit (Dita) married Dr. Shmuel Mandel. In the 1950s, the couple permanently left Israel and emigrated to the [[United States]]. This caused a permanent rift in the family. Shmuel and Vera Scheinerman were greatly hurt by their daughter's choice to leave Israel. As a result, Vera Scheinerman willed only a small part of her estate to Dita, an act which enraged her. At one point, Dita decided to return to Israel, but after Vera was informed by the Israel Lands Administration that it would not be legally possible to split the family property between Ariel and Dita, and informed her that she would not be able to build a home there, Dita, believing she was being lied to, permanently cut her family in Israel off, and refused to attend the funerals of her mother and sister-in-law. She reestablished contact after Sharon's stroke. Sharon's sister has rarely been mentioned in biographies of him: he himself rarely acknowledged her and only mentioned her twice in his autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/his-sometime-sister-1.22852|title=His Sometime Sister|date=5 April 2018|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3198544,00.html|title=Sharon's 'lost sister' calls from America |author= Shiffer, Shimon |date=1 November 2006|work=[[Ynetnews]] |accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romantic orientation''', also called '''affectional orientation''', indicates the [[sex]] or [[gender]] with which a person is most likely to have a [[romance (love)|romantic relationship]] or [[Falling in love|fall in love]]. It is used both alternatively and side by side with the term ''[[sexual orientation]]'', and is based on the perspective that [[sexual attraction]] is but a single component of a larger dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Crethar, H. C. &amp; Vargas, L. A. (2007). ''Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling.'' In J. Gregoire &amp; C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. {{ISBN|0-8058-5684-6}}. p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although a [[pansexuality|pansexual]] person may feel sexually attracted to people regardless of gender, they may experience romantic attraction and intimacy with women only.

For [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards and Barker&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Christina|last1= Richards|first2= Meg|last2= Barker|title=Sexuality and Gender for Mental Health Professionals: A Practical Guide|isbn=978-1-4462-9313-3|publisher=[[Sage Publications|SAGE]]|year=2013|pages=124–127|accessdate=July 3, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSiXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cerankowski and Milks&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Karli June|last1=Cerankowski|first2= Megan|last2=Milks|title=Asexualities: Feminist and Queer Perspectives|isbn=978-1-134-69253-8|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|pages=89–93|accessdate=July 3, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLgTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between sexual attraction and romantic attraction is still under debate, and is not fully understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houdenhove|first=Ellen Van|last2=Gijs|first2=Luk|last3=T'Sjoen|first3=Guy|last4=Enzlin|first4=Paul|date=April 21, 2014|title=Asexuality: A Multidimensional Approach|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=52|issue=6|pages=669–678|doi=10.1080/00224499.2014.898015|issn=0022-4499|pmid=24750031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic identities==
People may or may not engage in purely emotional [[Romance (love)|romantic]] relationships. The main identities relating to this are:&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards and Barker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cerankowski and Milks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lgbtqia.ucdavis.edu/educated/glossary|title=LGBTQIA Resource Center Glossary {{!}} LGBTQIA Resource Center|website=lgbtqia.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2019-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/panromantic|title=Is Being Panromantic The Same Thing As Being Pansexual?|website=Healthline|access-date=2019-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Aromantic''': No romantic attraction towards anyone ([[#Aromanticism|aromanticism]], see section below).
* '''Heteroromantic''' (or '''''heteromantic'''''): Romantic attraction towards person(s) of the opposite gender (heteroromanticism).
* '''Homoromantic''': Romantic attraction towards person(s) of the same gender (homoromanticism).
* '''Biromantic''': Romantic attraction towards person(s) of two or more genders (biromanticism). Sometimes used the same way as panromantic.
* '''Panromantic''': Romantic attraction towards person(s) of any, every, and all genders (panromanticism).
* '''Demiromantic''': Romantic attraction towards any of the above but only after forming a deep emotional bond with the person(s) (demiromanticism).
* '''Greyromantic''': Experiencing romantic attraction rarely or only under certain circumstances (greyromanticism).

==Relationship with sexual orientation and asexuality==
The implications of the distinction between romantic and sexual orientations have not been fully recognized, nor have they been studied extensively.{{sfn|Bogaert|2012|p=14}} It is common for sources to describe sexual orientation as including components of both sexual and romantic (or romantic equivalent) attractions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Bogaert|2012|p=14}} Publications investigating the relationship between sexual orientation and romantic orientation are limited.

==Aromanticism==
{{Redirect|Aromanticism|the album by Moses Sumney|Aromanticism (album)}}[[File:Aromantic Pride Flag.svg|thumb|Aromantic flag]]
One of the attributes of aromantic people is that, despite feeling no romantic attraction, they may still enjoy sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a9644122/aromantic-definition-meaning/ |title=What is Aromantic - Asexual vs. Aromantic Definition, Explained |publisher=Cosmopolitan.com |date=2017-05-12 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2019}} Aromantic people are not necessarily incapable of feeling love. For example, they may still feel familial love, or the type of [[platonic love]] that is expressed between friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.them.us/story/facts-you-should-know-about-aromantic-people|title=7 Facts You Should Know About Aromantic People|last=Plonski|first=Logan|website=them.|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some aromantic people may claim that they are able to appreciate the type of love or romance that exists in popular culture, such as in movies, romantic books or songs, but only vicariously, and that they do not intuitively experience these feelings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/02/12/youtuber-connie-glynn-aka-noodlerella-reveals-aromantic-7306105/ |title=YouTuber Connie Glynn aka Noodlerella reveals she's aromantic &amp;#124; Metro News |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2018-02-12 |accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aromantic people are [[asexuality|asexual]],&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian&quot;/&gt; but the term ''aromantic'' can be used in relation to various [[sexual identities]], such as aromantic bisexual, aromantic heterosexual, aromantic lesbian, aromantic gay man or aromantic asexual.&lt;ref&gt;Youth, Gender Creative. &quot;GLOSSARY OF TERMS: DEFINING A COMMON QUEER LANGUAGE.&quot; TEACHING, AFFIRMING, AND RECOGNIZING TRANS AND GENDER CREATIVE YOUTH: 299.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because aromanticism primarily deals with romantic attraction rather than with sexuality or with the [[libido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinto | first1 = Stacy Anne | year = 2014 | title = ASEXUally: On being an ally to the asexual community | url = | journal = Journal of LGBT Issues in Counseling | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 331–343 | doi = 10.1080/15538605.2014.960130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anoa''', also known as '''midget buffalo''' and '''sapiutan''', are a subgenus of ''[[Bubalus]]'' comprising two species endemic to the island of [[Sulawesi]] in [[Indonesia]]: the '''mountain anoa''' (''Bubalus quarlesi'') and the '''lowland anoa''' (''Bubalus depressicornis''). Both live in undisturbed rainforest and are similar in appearance to miniature [[water buffalo]], weighing {{convert|150|-|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

Both species of anoa have been classified as [[endangered]] since the 1960s and the populations continue to decrease.  Fewer than 5,000 animals of each species likely remain.  Reasons for their decline include hunting for [[hide (skin)|hide]]s, [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s and [[meat]] by the local peoples and [[loss of habitat]] due to the advancement of settlement.  Currently, hunting is the more serious factor in most areas.

After a study of the skulls of many anoa, it was shown that there was hybridizing and interbreeding between the two. It was questioned as to whether the two species were actually different due to mixing of the two in many different areas, as well as some interbreeding. After analyzing the DNA barcode of the two, it was proven that they are in fact different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Priyono|first=Dwi|last2=Solihin|first2=Dedy|last3=Farajallah|first3=Achmad|last4=Arini|first4=Diah|date=2018-11-01|title=Anoa, dwarf buffalo from Sulawesi, Indonesia: Identification based on DNA barcode|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328138675_Anoa_dwarf_buffalo_from_Sulawesi_Indonesia_Identification_based_on_DNA_barcode|journal=Biodiversitas|volume=19|pages=1985–1992|doi=10.13057/biodiv/d190602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lowland anoa ==
[[File:Lowland Anoa.JPG|thumb|left|Lowland anoa]]
The '''lowland anoa''' (''Bubalus depressicornis'') is a small [[bovid]], standing barely over {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder. It is also known as ''anoa de Ilanura'' or ''anoa des plaines''. It is most closely allied to the larger Asian buffaloes, showing the same reversal of the direction of the hair on their backs. The [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness, although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes. White spots are sometimes present below the eyes and there may be white markings on the legs and back; the absence or presence of these white markings may be indicative of distinct [[Race (biology)|race]]s. The horns of the cows are very small. The nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct Asian buffaloes, the remains of which have been found in the [[Siwalik Hills]] of northern India. In habits, the animal appears to resemble the [[water buffalo]].&lt;!-- [[Water buffalo]]? --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anoa|volume=2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually solitary, living in [[lowland]] [[tropical rainforest|forests]] and [[wetland]]s, browsing on plants and [[understory]].

== Mountain anoa ==
[[File:Buablus quarlesi2.jpg|left|thumb|Mountain anoa]]
The '''mountain anoa''' (''Bubalus quarlesi'') is also known as Quarle's anoa, ''anoa de montana'', ''anoa de Quarle'', ''anoa des montagnes'' and ''anoa pegunungan''. Standing at {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, it is even smaller than the lowland anoa and the smallest of all living [[Bovini|wild cattle]]. They also have longer, [[wool]]ier hair that moults every February to April, showing faint spots on the head, neck and limbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARKive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/mountain-anoa/bubalus-quarlesi|title=Mountain anoa videos, photos and facts – Bubalus quarlesi – ARKive|work=ARKive|access-date=2011-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913140513/http://www.arkive.org/mountain-anoa/bubalus-quarlesi/|archive-date=2011-09-13|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both are found on the island of [[Sulawesi]] and the nearby island of [[Buton]] in [[Indonesia]]. They apparently live singly or in pairs, rather than in herds like most cattle, except when the cows are about to give birth. Little is known about their life history as well. However, in captive individuals they have a life expectancy of 20–30 years. The anoa take two to three years before they reach sexual maturity and have one calf a year and have very rarely been seen to have more.

==Habitat==
Both the lowland anoa (''Bubalus depressicornis'') and the mountain anoa (''Bubalus quarlesi'') are endemic to the islands of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Sulawesi is a unique area due to the fact that roughly 61% of the species found there are endemic species, including the anoa.

The key difference between the two species is the areas of habitat that is utilized on the islands. The mountain anoa is found at higher elevations than its lowland counterpart and is found in the forested mountainous regions. The lowland anoa spends its time in the lower elevation areas and is also found in core habitat of forested area. The habitat needs of both species can have some overlap and oftentimes the two species are found in the same area. The key factor to where they are found is core fore

==Morphology==
The anoa have many physical characteristics of bovine relatives and are considered to be most closely related to the water buffalo, which was confirmed through DNA analysis. However, some scientists believe they may be more closely related to the Asian [[antelope]]. All anoa vary in appearance, but have the same standard characters.

The two species diverged due to a difference in elevation and a slight change in habitat from the latter, but their physical characteristics remain similar. The anoa is the smallest of the wild cattle species. When anoa are born, they have a set of thick, woolly fur that comes in many color variations ranging from yellow to brown. In adults, the fur is typically brown or black and males tend to have darker variations. Hair thickness varies slightly between the two species based on elevation and distribution. In both species of anoa, horns are present on both males and females and are typically straight protuberances. Another defining characteristic of the anoa is an extremely thick hide underneath the thick fur.

==Conservation==
The anoa are endemic to the island of Sulawesi and are currently experiencing large declines in their populations. Knowledge of their decline has only recently been documented, however, and the villages and villagers lack the knowledge of how to help maintain or increase populations.

The leading cause of their population decline is, in fact, hunting by the local villagers and not having restrictions or proper management strategies.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The one benefit is that villagers are open to communication with researchers on their harvests and hunting practices. The second leading cause of population decline is habitat loss and in the region of Tangkoko the anoa are actually extirpated.

Logging is a large issue due to the fact that both species prefer core forested habitat that is far away from humans and the influences that come with them. By logging, humans create much more fragmented habitat and, therefore, a decrease in the area where the anoa can breed and live. This habitat fragmentation also alters the natural mixing of populations of the anoa. This may lead to a loss in genetic diversity between the two species and, over time, could also lead to their decline.{{Clear}}

'''Agner Krarup Erlang''' (1 January 1878 – 3 February 1929) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[engineer]], who invented the fields of [[teletraffic engineering|traffic engineering]]{{r|Brockmeyer1948}} and [[queueing theory]].{{r|Achak2014}}

By the time of his relatively early death at the age of 51, Erlang had created the field of [[PSTN|telephone networks]] analysis. His early work in scrutinizing the use of local, exchange and trunk telephone line usage in a small community to understand the theoretical requirements of an efficient network led to the creation of the [[Erlang formula]], which became a foundational element of modern [[telecommunication]] network studies.

== Life ==
Erlang was born at Lønborg, near [[Tarm]], in [[Jutland]].  He was the son of a schoolmaster, and a descendant of [[Thomas Fincke]] on his mother's side.  At age 14, he passed the Preliminary Examination of the [[University of Copenhagen]] with distinction, after receiving dispensation to take it because he was younger than the usual minimum age.  For the next two years he taught alongside his father.{{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=10-12}}

A distant relative provided free board and lodging, and Erlang prepared for and took the University of [[Copenhagen]] entrance examination in 1896, and passed with distinction.  He won a scholarship to the University and majored in [[mathematics]], and also studied [[astronomy]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].  He graduated in 1901 with an MA and over the next 7 years taught at several schools.{{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=13}} He maintained his interest in mathematics, and received an award for a paper that he submitted to the University of Copenhagen.{{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=14}}

He was a member of the Danish Mathematicians' Association (DMF) and through this met amateur mathematician [[Johan Jensen (mathematician)|Johan Jensen]], the Chief Engineer of the [[Copenhagen Telephone Company]] (KTAS in Danish), an [[Corporate spin-off|offshoot]] of the [[International Bell Telephone Company]].{{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=14}} Erlang worked for the CTC (KTAS) from 1908 for almost 20 years, until his death in Copenhagen after an abdominal operation.{{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=19}}

He was an associate of the British [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]].{{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=18}}

== Contributions ==
While working for the CTC, Erlang was presented with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service.  His thinking went further by finding how many [[Switchboard operator |telephone operators]] were needed to handle a given volume of calls.  Most [[telephone exchange]]s then used human operators and [[telephone switchboard|cord boards]] to switch [[telephone call]]s by means of jack plugs.{{r|Achak2014}}

Out of necessity, Erlang was a hands-on researcher.  He would conduct measurements and was prepared to climb into street [[manhole]]s to do so. {{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=17}} &lt;!-- He famously said that this was a &quot;no brainer.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The actual quote in Danish w/translation would be desired. --&gt; He was also an expert in the history and calculation of the numerical tables of mathematical functions, particularly [[logarithm]]s. He devised new calculation methods for certain forms of tables.{{r|Brockmeyer1948b|p=109-110}}

He developed his theory of telephone traffic over several years. His significant publications include:
* 1909 – &quot;The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations&quot;, which proves that the [[Poisson distribution]] applies to random telephone traffic.{{r|Erlang1909|Erlang1925|Erlang1948a}}
* 1917 – &quot;Solution of some Problems in the Theory of Probabilities of Significance in Automatic Telephone Exchanges&quot;, which contains his classic formulae for [[Grade of service#Erlang's lost call assumptions|call loss]] and waiting time.{{r|Erlang1917|Erlang1948b}}
* 1920 - &quot;Telephone waiting times&quot;, which is Erlang's principal work on waiting times, assuming constant holding times.{{r|Erlang1920|Erlang1948c}}

These and other notable papers were translated into English, French and German.  His papers were prepared in a very brief style and can be difficult to understand without a background in the field.  One researcher from [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] is said to have learned Danish to study them.{{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=17}}

The [[BT Group plc|British Post Office]] accepted his formula as the basis for calculating circuit facilities.{{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=17}}

In 1946, the [[CCITT]] named the international unit of telephone traffic &quot;the [[Erlang (unit)|Erlang]]&quot;.{{r|CCITT1946}}{{r|Brockmeyer1948|p=19-22}} A statistical distribution and programming language listed below have also been named in his honour.

'''''Anyone Can Whistle''''' is a [[Musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]], and a book by [[Arthur Laurents]]. 

Described by theater historian [[Ken Mandelbaum]] as &quot;a satire on conformity and the insanity of the so-called sane,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Not Since Carrie: Forty Years of Broadway Musical Flops|last=Mandelbaum|first=Ken|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; the show tells a story of an economically-depressed town whose corrupt Mayoress, in an attempt to draw tourists, decides to create a fake &quot;miracle&quot; - which draws the attention of Fay Apple, an emotionally inhibited nurse, a crowd of inmates from a local asylum called &quot;The Cookie Jar,&quot; and a &quot;doctor&quot; with secrets of his own. 

Following a tryout period in Philadelphia, ''Anyone'' opened at the Majestic Theater on Broadway on April 4, 1964. The show received widely varied reviews (including negative notices from the ''New York Times'' and the ''New York Herald Tribune'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Not Since Carrie: Forty Years of Broadway Musical Flops|last=Mandelbaum|first=Ken|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and closed after a run of 12 previews and 9 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/anyone-can-whistle-3058|title=Anyone Can Whistle - Internet Broadway Database|last=|first=|date=|website=Internet Broadway Database|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the decades since its closing, ''Anyone'' has not been produced on the scale of other Sondheim musicals; notable productions include a 1995 concert version at Carnegie Hall, a pair of stagings in London and Los Angeles in 2003 that incorporated revisions, and a 2010 concert staging for the [[Encores!]] program at [[New York City Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sondheimguide.com/whistle.html#London|title=Sondheim Guide / Anyone Can Whistle|website=www.sondheimguide.com|access-date=2019-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, its score has become acclaimed as a part of Sondheim's canon, and songs such as the title tune, &quot;Everybody Says Don't&quot; and &quot;There Won't Be Trumpets&quot; have been widely performed. 

The show marked the stage musical debut of [[Angela Lansbury]]. 

==Background==
[[File:Remick-Lansbury-Guardino-Greene.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lee Remick]], [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Harry Guardino]], and [[Herbert Greene (Broadway conductor)|Herbert Greene]]  ]]
The show was first announced in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on October 5, 1961: &quot;For the winter of 1962, [Arthur Laurents] is nurturing another musical project, ''The Natives Are Restless''. The narrative and staging will be Mr. Laurent's handiwork; music and lyrics that of Stephen Sondheim. A meager description was furnished by Mr. Laurents, who refused to elaborate. Although the title might indicate otherwise, it is indigenous in content and contemporary in scope. No producer yet.&quot;&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horowitz |first1=Mark Eden |year=2010 |title=Really weird |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVII |issue=2 |pages=7 |publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X |url=http://www.sondheimreview.com/v17n2.htm#sample |access-date=2011-10-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720034853/http://sondheimreview.com/v17n2.htm#sample |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; No news of the show appeared until July 14, 1963, in an article in ''The New York Times'' about [[Kermit Bloomgarden]], where it discussed the four shows he was producing for the coming season; two were maybes, two were definite. One of the latter was a Sondheim-Laurents musical (now named ''Side Show'').&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt; In a letter to Bloomgarden, Laurents wrote, &quot;I beg you not to mention the money problems or any difficulties to Steve anymore. It depresses him terribly and makes it terribly difficult for him to work... It is damn hard to concentrate ... when all the atmosphere is filled with gloom and forebodings about will the show get the money to go on? ... Spare him the gory details.&quot; This behavior is considered unusual for Laurents, which runs contrary to his current reputation. Sondheim discovered that Laurents hated doing backers' auditions and he took over that responsibility, playing and singing more than 30. They found 115 investors to back the $350,000 production, including [[Richard Rodgers]] and Sondheim's father.&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;

Eager to work with both Laurents and Sondheim, Angela Lansbury accepted the lead role as Mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, despite her strong misgivings about the script and her ability to handle the score. Also signed were [[Lee Remick]] as Nurse Fay Apple and [[Harry Guardino]] as Hapgood. Laurents had wanted [[Barbra Streisand]] for the role of Fay, but she turned it down to star in ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, Arthur. ''Original Story By -: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood''. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2001, {{ISBN|1-55783-467-9}}, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;  Following rehearsals in New York City, the company started pre-Broadway tryouts in [[Philadelphia]] from March 2 to 21, 1964. Laurents, ignoring criticism about the show's message being trite and its absurdist style difficult to comprehend, poured his energies into restaging rather than dealing with the crux of the problem.

The show suffered further setbacks when supporting actor Henry Lascoe, who played Comptroller Schubb, suffered a heart attack during the show's out-of-town tryout, and was replaced by Gabriel Dell. According to Sondheim, &quot;Lansbury was so insecure onstage, and unhappy with her performance, that we considered replacing her. Ironically, it soon became apparent that it had been Lascoe, an old pro...who had made her feel like an amateur. The minute his much less confident understudy took over, she felt free to blossom, which she spectacularly did.&quot; Sondheim called the reviews &quot;humiliating&quot; and the audiences &quot;hostile.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Sondheim, Stephen. [https://archive.org/details/finishinghatcoll0000sond &lt;!-- quote=Henry Lascoe. --&gt; ''Anyone Can Whistle''.] ''Finishing the Hat: Collected Lyrics (1954-1981) With Attendant Comments...'', Random House Digital, Inc., 2010, {{ISBN|0679439072}}, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
After multiple revisions, the show opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on April 4, 1964, at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]], where it closed after 9 performances and 12 previews, unable to overcome negative notices from major papers such as the ''New York Times'' and the ''New York Herald Tribune''. Scenic design was by [[William and Jean Eckart]], costume design by [[Theoni V. Aldredge]], and lighting design by [[Jules Fisher]]. [[Choreographer]] [[Herbert Ross]] received the show's sole [[Tony Award]] nomination.

The show became a cult favorite, and a truncated original cast recording released by [[Columbia Records]] sold well among Sondheim fans and musical theatre buffs. &quot;There Won't Be Trumpets,&quot; a song cut during previews, has become a favorite of [[cabaret]] performers.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Stephen. ''Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical'' (2001). Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0-19-509601-0}}, pp. 128, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 1995, a staged concert was held at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City as a benefit for the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]]. The concert was recorded by [[Columbia Records]], preserving for the first time musical passages and numbers not included on the original Broadway cast recording. For example, the cut song &quot;There's Always A Woman&quot; was included at this concert. Lansbury served as narrator, with [[Madeline Kahn]] as Cora, [[Bernadette Peters]] as Fay, and [[Scott Bakula]] as Hapgood. Additional cast included [[Chip Zien]], [[Ken Page (Actor)|Ken Page]], and Harvey Evans, the only original cast member to reprise his original role.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/anyone-can-whistle-live-at-carnegie-hall-1995/ &quot; ''Anyone Can Whistle'' – Live at Carnegie Hall 1995&quot;] masterworksbroadway.com, accessed October 12, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Sony]] reissued the original Broadway cast recording on [[compact disc]]. Two revivals were staged that year, one in London, at the Bridewell Theatre, and one in Los Angeles, at the Matrix Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/whistle.html#London &quot;Sondheim Guide Listing.&quot;] sondheimguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Act 1===
The story is set in an imaginary American town that has gone bankrupt.  (Its former major industry was the production of an unidentified product that never wore out.  Everyone has one now, and no one needs a replacement.)  The only place in town doing good business is the local [[Sanatorium]], known as “The Cookie Jar,” whose inmates look much healthier than the disgruntled townspeople. (&quot;I'm Like the Bluebird&quot;)  All the money is in the hands of Cora Hoover Hooper, the stylish, ruthless mayoress and her cronies - Comptroller Schub, Treasurer Cooley, and Police Chief Magruder. Cora appears carried in a litter by her backup singers, and admits that she can accept anything except unpopularity (“Me and My Town”). The scheming Comptroller Schub tells her that he has a plan to save her administration, and the town, promising “It's highly unethical.” He tells her to meet him at the rock on the edge of town.  At the rock, a local mother, Mrs. Schroeder, tries to tell her child, Baby Joan, to come down from the rock, when Baby Joan licks it - and a spring of water begins flowing from it. The town instantly proclaims a miracle, and Cora and her council eagerly anticipate tourist dollars as they boast of the water's curative powers. (&quot;Miracle Song&quot;)  It is soon revealed to Cora that the miracle is a fake, controlled by a pump inside the rock.  The only person in town who doubts the miracle is Fay Apple, an eternally skeptical young nurse from the Cookie Jar who refuses to believe in miracles.  She appears at the rock with all forty-nine of the inmates, or “Cookies” in tow, intending to let them take some of the water. Schub realizes that if they drink the water and do not change, people will discover the fake. As he tries to stop Fay, the inmates mingle with the townspeople, until no one can guess who is who. Fay disappears, and hiding from the police, admits that she hopes for one miracle - for a hero who can come and deliver the town from the madness (“There Won't Be Trumpets”).  Cora arrives on the scene with the Cookie Jar's manager, Dr. Detmold, but he says that Fay has taken the records to identify the inmates. He tells Cora that he is expecting a new assistant who might help them. At that moment a mysterious stranger, J. Bowden Hapgood, arrives asking for directions to the Cookie Jar. He is instantly taken for the new assistant.  Asked to identify the missing Cookies, Hapgood begins questioning random people and sorting them into two groups, group A, and group one, but refuses to divulge which group is which.  The town council becomes suspicious of this and tries to force the truth out, but Hapgood questions them until they begin to doubt their own sanity. Cora is too caught up with his logic to care. (“Simple”) As the extended musical sequence ends, the lights black out except for a spotlight on Hapgood, who announces to the audience, “You are all mad!” Seconds later, the stage lights are restored.  The stage set has vanished, and the cast is revealed in theater seats, holding programs, applauding the audience, as the act ends.

===Act 2===
As act two opens, the two groups are now in bitter rivalry over who is the normal group (“A-1 March”) Another stranger, a French woman in a feathered coat appears.  It is really Fay Apple in disguise. She introduces herself as the Lady from Lourdes, a professional Miracle Inspector, come to investigate the miracle. As Schub runs off to warn Cora, Fay seeks out Hapgood in his hotel, and the two seduce each other in the style of a French romantic film. (“Come Play Wiz Me”) Fay tries to get Hapgood's help in exposing the miracle. Hapgood, however, sees through her disguise and wants to question her first.  Fay refuses to take her wig off, and confesses to him that this disguise, left over from a college play, is the only way she can break out of her rigid and cynical persona. She begins to hope, however, that Hapgood may be the one who can help her learn to be free. (“Anyone Can Whistle”) Meanwhile, the two groups continue to march, and Cora, trying to give a speech, realizes that Hapgood has stolen her limelight. (“A Parade in Town”) She and Schub plan an emergency meeting at her house.  Back at the hotel, Hapgood comes up with an idea, telling Fay to destroy the inmates' records. That way Fay can be free of them and they can stop pretending. When Fay is reluctant, Hapgood produces a record of his own - he is her fiftieth Cookie. He is a practicing idealist who, after years of attempted heroism, is tired of crusading and has come to the Cookie Jar to retire. Inspired by his record, Fay begins to tear the records up.  As she does, the Cookies appear and begin to dance (“Everybody Says Don't”).

===Act 3===
Act three begins with Cora at her house with her council. Schub has put the miracle on hiatus, but announces that they can easily turn the town against Hapgood by blaming him for it.  The group celebrates their alliance. (“I've Got You to Lean On”)  A mob quickly forms outside the hotel, and Hapgood and Fay, still disguised, take refuge under the rock. Discovering the fraud, Cora and the council confront them.  At that moment, Cora receives a telegram from the governor warning that if the quota of forty-nine cookies is not filled, she will be impeached. Schub tells her that since Hapgood never said who is normal or not, they can arrest anyone at random until the quota is filled.  Fay tries to get Hapgood to expose the miracle, but he warns her no one will believe it is a fake, because it works as a miracle should.  Fay wants his help stopping the Mayoress, but he refuses, since he is through with crusading. Although she knows she still isn't out of her shell, Fay angrily swears to go it alone. (“See What it Gets You”) As Cora and the police force begin rounding up Cookies, Fay tries to get the key away from the guards in an extended ballet sequence. (“The Cookie Chase”) As it ends, Fay is captured, and Dr. Detmold suddenly recognizes her. Fay tells the townspeople about the fake miracle, but the town refuses to believe her.  Detmold tells Cora that even without the records, Fay can identify the inmates from memory.  Cora warns that she will arrest forty-nine people, normal or not, and Fay, helplessly, identifies all the Cookies, except Hapgood.  She tells him the world needs people like him, and Hapgood can't turn himself in. He asks Fay to come with him, but she still can't bring herself to break free.  Parting ways, they reflect on what they briefly shared. (“With So Little to be Sure Of”) Word comes of a new miracle, two towns over, of a statue with a warm heart. Soon the town is all but deserted, and Cora is again upstaged. Again, Schub has the answer - since the Cookie Jar is still successful, they can turn the entire town into one big Cookie Jar! Cora realizes she and Schub are meant for each other, and they dance off together. As Fay resumes work, Detmold's real new assistant arrives, and Fay is horrified to realize that she is even more practical, rigid and disbelieving than Fay herself, and the new nurse marches the Cookies off to the next town to disprove the new miracle. Horrified at seeing what she might become, Fay returns to the rock calling for Hapgood. When he doesn't answer, she tries to whistle - and succeeds in blowing a shrill, ugly whistle. Hapgood appears again, saying 'That's good enough for me.' As they embrace, the water begins flowing from the rock - a true miracle this time. (Finale)

==Critical response==
[[Howard Taubman]] in his ''[[The New York Times]]'' review wrote that Laurents's &quot;book lacks the fantasy that would make the idea work, and his staging has not improved matters. Mr. Sondheim has written several pleasing songs but not enough of them to give the musical wings. The performers yell rather than talk and run rather than walk. The dancing is the cream.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taubman, Howard. &quot;Review&quot;, ''The New York Times'', April 6, 1964, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Suskin wrote in his 2000 book about Broadway composers: The &quot;fascinating extended musical scenes, with extended choral work, ... immediately marked Sondheim as the most distinctive theatre composer of his time. The first act sanity sequence ... and the third act chase ... are unlike anything that came before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_usBBxC_TQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA278&amp;lpg=RA1-PA278&amp;dq=rodgers+%22the+mad+show%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7zevwJ-Ydh&amp;sig=_9YhHbF8XUK1a9YtH9_rrZGzz50 &quot;Show Tunes: The Songs, Shows, and Careers of Broadway's Major Composers&quot; (2000), Steven Suskin, Oxford University Press, p. 278] {{ISBN|0-19-512599-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RevDrink.JPG|thumb|Two bottles of blue [[Rev (drink)|Rev]], a vodka cooler from Canada]]
An '''alcopop''' (or '''cooler''', '''spirit cooler''' in [[South African English]], or '''malternative''' in America) is any of certain flavored [[alcoholic beverage]]s with relatively low alcohol content (e.g., 3–7% [[alcohol by volume]]), including:
# [[Malt beverage]]s to which various fruit [[juice]]s or other flavorings have been added
# Beverages containing wine to which ingredients such as fruit juice or other flavorings have been added ([[wine cooler]]s)
# Beverages containing [[Distilled beverage|distilled alcohol]] and sweet liquids such as fruit juices or other flavourings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=51&amp;GA=95&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=1625&amp;GAID=9&amp;LegID=29771&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= SB1625, Illinois General Assembly 1977] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205091420/http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=51&amp;GA=95&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=1625&amp;GAID=9&amp;LegID=29771&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= |date=2008-12-05 }} (Amendment to The Liquor Control Act of 1934, Section 6-35; 235 ILCS 5/6-35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''alcopop''' (a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''alcohol'' and ''[[soft drink|pop]]'') is used commonly in the United Kingdom to describe these drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.marininstitute.org/alcopops/resources/Alcopop_QA.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511223144/http://www.marininstitute.org/alcopops/resources/Alcopop_QA.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms include '''FAB''' (flavored alcoholic beverage), '''FMB''' (flavored malt beverage),&lt;ref name=&quot;CBE&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boe.ca.gov/sptaxprog/pdf/fmbpaper2.pdf|title=California Board of Equalization. Flavored Malt Beverages, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''PPS''' (pre-packaged spirit or premium packaged spirits), and '''RTD''' ([[ready-to-drink]] – [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]).

== Description ==
There are a variety of beverages produced and marketed around the world as well as within each market which are described as coolers or alcopops. They tend to be [[sweetness|sweet]] and served in small [[bottle]]s (typically 355 ml (the normal size of a soda pop can) in the US, 275 ml in South Africa and Germany, 330 ml in Canada and Europe), and between 4% and 7% [[alcohol by volume|ABV]]. In Europe, Canada, and South Africa coolers tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g. [[Smirnoff Ice]]) or rum (e.g. [[Bacardi Breezer]]). In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as [[hops|un-hopped]] [[beer]]s, depending on the state in which they are sold. Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent addition of alcohol (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring. Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can therefore be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks. There are, however, stronger ones that ''are'' simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g. Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can be sold only where hard liquor is available.

In the United States there is a proportionally limited tax on alcopops relative to those sold in Europe, although some states are considering legislation to bring their tax levels closer to the European model, which is credited with limiting consumption by youth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

According to the US [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Flavored malt beverages are brewery products that differ from traditional malt beverages such as beer, ale, lager, porter, stout, or malt liquor in several respects. Flavored malt beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or malt beverage character. Their flavor is derived primarily from added flavors rather than from malt and other materials used in fermentation. At the same time, flavored malt beverages are marketed in traditional beer-type bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and malt beverage wholesalers, and their alcohol content is similar to other malt beverages in the 4-6% alcohol by volume range.

Although flavored malt beverages are produced at breweries, their method of production differs significantly from the production of other malt beverages and beer. In producing flavored malt beverages, brewers brew a fermented base of beer from malt and other brewing materials. Brewers then treat this base using a variety of processes in order to remove malt beverage character from the base. For example, they remove the color, bitterness, and taste generally associated with beer, ale, porter, stout, and other malt beverages. This leaves a base product to which brewers add various flavors, which typically contain distilled spirits, to achieve the desired taste profile and alcohol level.

While the alcohol content of flavored malt beverages is similar to that of most traditional malt beverages, the alcohol in many of them is derived primarily from the distilled spirits component of the added flavors rather than from fermentation.
:—70 Fed. Reg. 194 et seq. (January 3, 2005)&lt;ref name=&quot;CBE&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some [[Continental Europe]]an countries, such as [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], bottled [[beer cocktail]]s and [[Shandy|shandies]] are available, which are being marketed the same way like alcopops. However, these beverages are based on traditional hopped beers and therefore not considered to be alcopops.

== History ==

[[File:Bacardibreezer.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Bacardi Breezer]]s]]

Wine coolers gained popularity in the US market in the 1980s when [[Bartles and Jaymes]] began advertising their brand of wine coolers, which were followed by other brands, including when [[Bacardi]] introduced the [[Bacardi Breezer|Breezer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.distell.co.za/agechecker/?brand=/brands/default.aspx|title=Age Checker &amp;#124; Distell|website=www.distell.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growth in popularity occurred around 1993 with [[Two Dogs]], DNA Alcoholic Spring Water, [[Hooper's Hooch]] and [[Zima (drink)|Zima]], which was marketed under the title of &quot;malternative beverage.&quot; [[Wine coolers]] were on the decline due to the increase in the US federal wine tax, and using a malt-beverage base became the new industry standard. Later, [[Mike's Hard Lemonade]] was released in the United States, with humorous commercials depicting what they called &quot;violence against lemons&quot;. [[Smirnoff]] also came out with another [[citrus]]-[[flavor]]ed [[malt beverage]] in the United States in the late 1990s called [[Smirnoff Ice]], which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places. (In the UK, Smirnoff Ice is marketed by [[Diageo]] as a PPS.){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Some{{who|date=March 2018}} have expressed concern that such drinks might appeal to children as they tend to be sweet and brightly colored. Many [[Alcohol advertising|cooler advertising campaigns]] have been criticized as trying to make 'alcopops' appeal to young drinkers. In the United Kingdom, that led to a media outcry during the mid-1990s as the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] press associated alcopops with under-age drinking which damaged sales and would lead to [[off-licence]]s withdrawing them from their stores.
In response to a complaint from the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI), the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) conducted an extensive investigation in 2001. The agency &quot;found no evidence of intent to target minors with the FMB products, packaging, or advertising. Furthermore, after reviewing the consumer survey evidence submitted by CSPI in support of the proposition that FMBs were predominantly popular with minors, the FTC concluded that flaws in the survey's methodology limited the ability to draw conclusions from the survey data.&quot;

The Federal Trade Commission again in 2003 investigated FMB ads, [[product placement]], and internal company marketing documents after a directive from the conferees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. &quot;The Commission's investigation found no evidence of targeting underage consumers in the marketing of FMBs. Adults 21 to 29 appear to be the intended target of FMB marketing&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission. ''[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/09/alcohol08report.pdf Alcohol Marketing and Advertising: A Report to Congress]''. Washington, DC: Federal Trade Commission, 2003. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and found that &quot;the majority of FMB drinkers are over the age of 27.&quot;&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/09/alcohol08report.pdf Alcohol Marketing and Advertising: A Report to Congress]''. Washington, DC: Federal Trade Commission, 2003. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] raised the tax on flavored malt beverages to equal that of spirits, the second highest in [[Europe]]. [[Germany]] has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 [[euro]] per bottle effective August 1, 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to [[wine coolers]], which are being marketed the same way. Some bottles now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by people under the legal drinking age (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the United States). On May 11, 2008, the [[Australia]]n Government increased the excise tax on alcopops by 70%, to bring it in line with the tax on spirits. There is the concern this tax will encourage consumers to buy straight spirits and mix the drinks themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/expert-report-backs-alcopop-tax-hike-20080917-4i2p.html|title=Expert report backs alcopop tax hike|last=Jenkins|first=Melissa|date=2008-09-16|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly resulting in drinks with a higher alcohol concentration than the premixed alternatives.

== Attempts to discourage &quot;alcopops&quot; ==
=== Australia ===
The Australian government increased the tax on these drinks under the [[2008 Australian federal budget|2008 budget]] to the same rate as spirits, volumetrically, in an effort to stop [[binge drinking]]. The tax was criticized by the opposition as a tax grab, and voted down in the Senate on March 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/national/alcopops-tax-fails-to-pass-senate-20090318-91zw.html Alcopops tax fails to pass Senate], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 18 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Before its rejection, the tax had already raised at least A$290 million after April 2008.&lt;ref name=TryAgain/&gt; In April 2009, some Labor party MPs planned to resubmit the tax to the Senate,&lt;ref name=TryAgain&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25337669-421,00.html Government to try again with alcopops tax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418161735/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C27574%2C25337669-421%2C00.html |date=2009-04-18 }}, news.com.au, 15 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was finally approved in August 2009, increasing the tax on the drinks from $39.36 to $66.67 per litre of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian Tax on Alcopops|url=http://www.ias.org.uk/What-we-do/Publication-archive/The-Globe/Issue-1-2009/Australian-Tax-on-Alcopops.aspx|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study concluded that the tax had no impact on binge drinking of the drinks by teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/alcopop-tax-fails-to-deter-teen-binge-drinking-raises-45-billion-in-revenue/story-fneuz92c-1226650824648|title='Alcopop' tax fails to deter teen binge drinking, raises $4.5 billion in revenue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
On 1 July 2004 the German government increased the tax on mixed drinks based on spirits (e.g. vodka, rum) by roughly one Euro per 275-ml-bottle in order to discourage teenagers drinking excessively, although those drinks were already prohibited for those under the age of 18. This had two implications: The most common alcopops, such as [[Smirnoff Ice]] or [[Bacardi Breezer]], were nearly taken off the market, while other manufacturers changed the recipes of their drinks to replace spirit alcohols with wine or beer, but with the same [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], enabling these mixed drinks (which are not &quot;alcopops&quot; under German law) to be sold legally to minors 16 and 17 years of age.

=== Philippines ===
In 2019, some senators including [[Pia Cayetano]] and former Special Assistant to the President [[Bong Go]] called for pullout of alcopops from the market due to &quot;deceptive packaging that resembles fruit juices usually bought by young consumers&quot;. Alcopops also have seven percent alcohol content, which is slightly lower than that of local beer brand [[Red Horse Beer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/08/22/pull-out-alcopop-drinks-from-grocery-shelves-bong-go-urges|title=Pull out Alcopop drinks from grocery shelves, Bong Go urges|website=Manila Bulletin News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/238127-senators-take-sip-alcopops-alcohol-tax-hearing|title=LOOK: Senators take a sip of alcopops during alcohol tax hearing|first=Ralf|last=Rivas|website=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, &quot;spirit coolers&quot; cannot be sold to persons under the age of 18. They are only sold at liquor stores.

=== United Kingdom ===
In June 1997, [[Co-op Food]] became the first major retailer to place an outright ban on the sale of alcopops in its shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/co-op-places-ban-on-alcopops-1255741.html|title=Co-op places ban on alcopops|website=[[The Independent]]|last=Cope|first=Nigel|date=13 June 1997|access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been rescinded.

In [[chemistry]], an '''alkali''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|k|əl|aɪ}}; from {{lang-ar|القلوي}} ''al-qaly'' &quot;ashes of the [[saltwort]]&quot;) is a [[base (chemistry)|basic]], [[ionic compound|ionic]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of an [[alkali metal]] or [[alkaline earth metal]] [[chemical element]]. An alkali also can be defined as a base that dissolves in [[water]]. A solution of a soluble base has a [[pH]] greater than 7.0. The [[adjective]] '''alkaline''' is commonly, and  '''alkalescent''' less often, used in [[English language|English]] as a [[synonym]] for basic, especially for bases soluble in water. This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the [[acid-base reaction theories#Arrhenius theory|Arrhenius]] definition of a base, and they are still among the most common bases.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;alkali&quot; is derived from Arabic ''al qalīy'' (or ''alkali''),&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated148&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chambers's encyclopaedia]]: a dictionary of universal knowledge, Volume 1|publisher=J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co|year=1888|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning ''the calcined ashes'' (see [[calcination]]), referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burned plant ashes, called [[potash]] and composed mostly of potassium carbonate, was mildly basic. After heating this substance with [[calcium hydroxide]] (''slaked lime''), a far more strongly basic substance known as ''caustic potash'' ([[potassium hydroxide]]) was produced. Caustic potash was traditionally used in conjunction with animal fats to produce soft [[soap]]s, one of the caustic processes that rendered soaps from fats in the process of [[saponification]], one known since antiquity. Plant potash lent the name to the element [[potassium]], which was first derived from caustic potash, and also gave potassium its chemical symbol '''K''' (from the German name Kalium), which ultimately derived from al'''k'''ali.

==Common properties of alkalis and bases==
Alkalis are all Arrhenius bases, ones which form hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) when dissolved in water. Common properties of alkaline aqueous [[solution]]s include:
* Moderately concentrated solutions (over 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; M) have a pH of 7.1 or greater. This means that they will turn [[phenolphthalein]] from colorless to pink.
* Concentrated solutions are [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] (causing chemical burns).
* Alkaline solutions are slippery or soapy to the touch, due to the [[saponification]] of the fatty substances on the surface of the skin.
* Alkalis are normally [[solubility|water-soluble]], although some like [[barium carbonate]] are only soluble when reacting with an acidic aqueous solution.

==Difference between alkali and base==
The terms &quot;base&quot; and &quot;alkali&quot; are often used interchangeably, particularly outside the context of [[chemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]].

There are various more specific definitions for the concept of an alkali. Alkalis are usually defined as a subset of the bases. One of two subsets is commonly chosen.
* A basic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=alkali Alkali | Define Alkali at Dictionary.com]. Dictionary.reference.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; (This includes Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but excludes NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.)
* Any base that is soluble in water and forms hydroxide ions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/alkali alkali – definition of alkali by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia]. Thefreedictionary.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chung, L.H.M. (1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/20061124183909/http://www.wahyan.edu.hk/paulsir/handout/form4/4-05_Characteriscs_of_alkali.pdf &quot;Characteristics of Alkali&quot;], pp. 363–365 in ''Integrated Chemistry Today''. {{ISBN|9789623722520}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the solution of a base in water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krysstal.com/acidbase.html Acids, Bases and Salts]. KryssTal. Retrieved on 2012-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; (This includes Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.)

The second subset of bases is also called an &quot;[[Acid–base reaction#Arrhenius theory|Arrhenius base]]&quot;.

==Alkali salts==

Alkali salts are soluble hydroxides of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], of which common examples are:

* [[Sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) &amp;ndash; often called &quot;caustic soda&quot;
* [[Potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) &amp;ndash; commonly called &quot;caustic potash&quot;
* [[Lye]] &amp;ndash; generic term for either of two previous salts or their mixture
* [[Calcium hydroxide]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;ndash; saturated solution known as &quot;[[limewater]]&quot;
* [[Magnesium hydroxide]] (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;ndash; an atypical alkali since it has low solubility in water (although the dissolved portion is considered a strong base due to complete dissociation of its ions)

==Alkaline soil==
{{main|Alkali soil}}
Soils with pH values that are higher than 7.3 are usually defined as being alkaline. These soils can occur naturally, due to the presence of alkali salts. Although many plants do prefer slightly basic soil (including vegetables like [[cabbage]] and fodder like [[buffalo grass]]), most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil (with pHs between 6.0 and 6.8), and [[alkaline soil]]s can cause problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated148&quot;/&gt;

==Alkali lakes==

In [[Soda lake|alkali lake]]s (also called ''soda lakes''), evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring carbonate salts, giving rise to an alkalic and often saline lake.

'''''Ain't I a Woman? Black Women and Feminism''''' is a 1981 book by [[bell hooks]] titled after [[Sojourner Truth]]'s &quot;[[Ain't I a Woman?]]&quot; speech. Hooks examines the effect of [[racism]] and [[sexism]] on black women, the [[civil right]]s movement, and [[feminist]] movements from [[suffrage]] to the 1970s. She argues that the convergence of sexism and racism during slavery contributed to black women having the lowest status and worst conditions of any group in American society. White female [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and suffragists were often more comfortable with black male abolitionists such as [[Frederick Douglass]], while southern [[Racial segregation|segregationalists]] and stereotypes of black [[female promiscuity]] and immorality caused protests whenever black women spoke. Hooks points out that these white female reformers were more concerned with white morality than the conditions these morals caused black Americans.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite web|title=Ain't I a Woman? |url=http://www.debate.org/reference/aint-i-a-woman |publisher=debate.org |accessdate=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111190336/http://www.debate.org/reference/aint-i-a-woman |archivedate=11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, she argues that the stereotypes that were set during slavery still affect black women today. She argued that slavery allowed white society to [[stereotype]] white women as the pure goddess [[virgin]] and move black women to the seductive whore stereotype formerly placed on all women, thus justifying the devaluation of black femininity and rape of black women. The work which black women have been forced to perform, either in slavery or in a discriminatory workplace, that would be non-gender conforming for white women has been used against black women as a proof of their emasculating behaviour. bell hooks argues that [[black nationalism]] was largely a patriarchal and [[misogynist]] movement, seeking to overcome racial divisions by strengthening sexist ones, and that it readily latched onto the idea of the emasculating black ''[[matriarch]]'' proposed by [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], whose theories bell hooks often criticizes.

Meanwhile, she says, the &quot;feminist movement&quot;, a largely white middle and upper class affair, did not articulate the needs of poor and non-white women, thus reinforcing sexism, racism, and [[classism]]. She suggests this explains the low numbers of black women who participated in the feminist movement in the 1970s, pointing to [[Louis Harris]]' [[Virginia Slims]] poll done in 1972 for [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] that she says showed 62 percent of black women supported &quot;efforts to change women's status&quot; and 67 percent &quot;sympathized with the women's rights movement&quot;, compared with 45 and 35 percent of white women (also Steinem, 1972). &lt;!-- Please verify the quoted sections are the exact phrasing of the survey. --&gt;

Since its publication, ''Ain't I a Woman'' has been critically acclaimed as groundbreaking in the study of feminist theory for discussing the correlation between the history of oppression black women have faced in the United States and its lingering effects in modern American society.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/books/bell-hooks-min-jin-lee-aint-i-a-woman.html|title=In Praise of bell hooks|last=Jin Lee|first=Min|date=Feb 28, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is commonly used in gender studies, Black studies, and philosophy courses.

'''AMOS BASIC''' is a dialect of the [[BASIC]] [[programming language]] implemented on the [[Amiga]] computer. AMOS BASIC was published by [[Europress Software]] and originally written by [[François Lionet]] with [[Constantin Sotiropoulos]].

== History ==
AMOS is a descendant of [[STOS BASIC]] for the [[Atari ST]]. AMOS BASIC was first produced in 1990.

AMOS competed on the Amiga platform with Acid Software's [[Blitz BASIC]]. Both BASICs differed from other dialects on different platforms, in that they allowed the easy creation of fairly demanding multimedia software, with full structured code and many high-level functions to load images, animations, sounds and display them in various ways.

The original AMOS version was [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] which, whilst working fine, suffered the same disadvantage of any language being run interpretively. By all accounts, AMOS was extremely fast among interpreted languages. The language was fast enough that an extension called AMOS 3D could produce playable 3D games even on plain 7&amp;nbsp;MHz Amigas. Later, an AMOS [[compiler]] was developed that further increased speed.

AMOS could also include inline Assembly Language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/1990-lionet-francois-amos-the-creator-user-guide/1990-lionet-francois-amos-the-creator-user-guide_djvu.txt The Creator], by Frangois Lionet, 1990, ''&quot;AMOS Basic includes special facilities which allow you to combine assembly language routines with your Basic programs.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

To simplify animation of sprites, AMOS included the AMOS Animation Language (AMAL), a compiled sprite scripting language which runs independently of the main AMOS BASIC program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grove.ufl.edu/~cwarner/computers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208051702/http://grove.ufl.edu/~cwarner/computers.html |archivedate=2010-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also possible to control screen and &quot;rainbow&quot; effects using AMAL scripts. AMAL scripts in effect created CopperLists, small routines executed by the Amiga's Agnus chip.

After the original version of AMOS, Europress released a compiler ('''AMOS Compiler'''), and two other versions of the language: '''Easy AMOS''', a simpler version for beginners, and '''AMOS Professional''', a more advanced version with added features, such as a better [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], [[ARexx]] support, a new [[user interface|UI]] API and new [[control flow|flow control constructs]]. Neither of these new versions was significantly more popular than the original AMOS.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=For example, from my experience it was way more popular. References to sales figures or alike would be nice.}}

AMOS was mostly used to make multimedia software, [[video game]]s (platformers and graphical adventures) and educational software.

The language was mildly successful within the Amiga community. Its ease of use made it especially attractive to beginners.

Perhaps AMOS BASIC's biggest disadvantage, stemming from its Atari ST lineage, was its incompatibility with the Amiga's [[AmigaOS|operating system]] functions and interfaces. Instead, AMOS BASIC controlled the computer directly, which caused programs written in it to have a non-standard user interface, and also caused compatibility problems with newer versions of hardware.

Today the language has declined in popularity along with the Amiga computer for which it was written. Despite this, a small community of enthusiasts are still using it. The [[source code]] to AMOS was released around 2001 under a [[BSD licenses|BSD style license]] by [[Clickteam]] - a company that includes the original programmer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071130053321/http://clickteam.com/eng/downloadcenter.php?i=58 Amos &amp; Stos » Main Download] on clickteam.com (archived 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 4th of April, 2019 [[François Lionet]] announced the release of AMOS2 on his website [http://amos2.tech/ amos2.tech]. AMOS2 replaces STOS and AMOS together, using [[JavaScript]] as its code interpreter, making the new development system independent and generally deployed in internet browsers.
Amos 2 is now called AOZ Studio https://www.aoz.studio

== Software ==
Software written using AMOS BASIC includes:

* ''[[Miggybyte]]''
* ''[[Scorched Tanks]]''
* Games by [[Vulcan Software]], amongst which was the ''[[Valhalla: Before the War|Valhalla]]'' trilogy
* Amiga version of ''[[Ultimate Domain]]'' (called ''[[Genesia (game)|Genesia]]'') by [[Microïds]]
* ''[[Flight of the Amazon Queen]]'', by [[Interactive Binary Illusions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnPassfield/20150601/244740/Making_of_Flight_of_the_Amazon_Queen__A_20th_Anniversary_Retrospective.php|title=Making of Flight of the Amazon Queen: A 20th Anniversary Retrospective |accessdate=1 January 2016|website=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arcadia 2001''' is a [[Second generation of video game consoles|second-generation]] [[8-bit]] [[home video game console]] released by [[Emerson Radio]] in May 1982, several months before the release of [[ColecoVision]]. It was discontinued only 18 months later, with a total of 35 games having been released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watcher reviews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Watcher|first=Dark|title=Emerson Arcadia 2001 - DW Facts|url=http://www.videogameconsolelibrary.com/pg80-arcadia.htm#page=reviews|publisher=Video Game Console Library|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson licensed the Arcadia 2001 to Bandai, which released it in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watcher reviews&quot;/&gt; Over 30 Arcadia 2001 clones exist.

The unrelated Arcadia Corporation, manufacturer of the [[Atari 2600]] [[Starpath Supercharger|Supercharger]] add-on, was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement. Arcadia Corporation then changed its name to [[Starpath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;starpath&quot;&gt;[http://thedoteaters.com/?bitstory=epyx The Dot Eaters - Epyx | The Dot Eaters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Arcadia is much smaller than its contemporary competitors and is powered by a standard 12-volt [[AC adapter|power supply]] so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. It also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.

The system came with two [[Intellivision]]-style controllers with a 12-button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides. The direction pads have a removable joystick attachment. Most games came with [[BoPET]] overlays that could be applied to the controller's keypads. The console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.

There are at least three different types of cartridge case styles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obsoletemedia.org/emerson-arcadia-2001/ obsoletemedia.org: Emerson Arcadia 2001 (1982 – 1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; and artwork, with variations on each. Emerson-family cartridges come in two different lengths (short and long) of black plastic cases.

In 1982, the Bandai Arcadia, a variant of the Emerson Arcadia 2001, was released in Japan by Bandai. There were four Japan-exclusive game releases developed by Bandai which were the only known Arcadia titles written by other companies than UA Ltd.

*''Doraemon''
*''Dr. Slump''
*''Mobile Soldier Gundam''
*''Super Dimension Fortress Macross''

==Reception==
After seeing the Arcadia 2001 at the summer 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], [[Danny Goodman]] of ''[[Creative Computing]] Video &amp; Arcade Games'' reported that its graphics were similar to the Atari 2600's, and that &quot;our overall impression of the game play was favorable for a system in this price range, though no cartridge stands out as being an exciting original creation&quot;. He called the controller offering both [[Intellivision]]-like disc and joystick functionality &quot;A great idea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;goodman1983spring&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Danny |author-link=Danny Goodman |date=Spring 1983 |title=Home Video Games: Video Games Update |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/vgupdate.php |magazine=Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games==
Emerson planned to launch the console with 19 games.{{r|goodman1983spring}} Some Arcadia 2001 games are ports of lesser-known arcade games such as ''Route 16'', ''Jungler'', and ''Jump Bug'', which were not available on other home systems.

Emerson actually created many popular arcade titles including ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'' for the Arcadia, but never had them manufactured as Atari started to sue its competitor companies for releasing games to which it had exclusive-rights agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/the_digs/arcadia/texts/2001-faq.htm |title=Arcadia 2001: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=digitpress.com|date=2002-06-04 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early marketing showed popular arcade games, but they were later released as clones. For instance, the Arcadia 2001 game ''Space Raiders'' is a clone of ''Defender'', and ''Breakaway'' is a clone of ''[[Breakout clone|Breakout]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lester|first=John|title=History of Consoles: Arcadia 2001 (1982)|url=http://gamester81.com/history-of-consoles-arcadia-2001-1982/|publisher=Gamster81|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''convex uniform honeycomb''' is a [[uniform polytope|uniform]] [[tessellation]] which fills three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] with non-overlapping [[convex polyhedron|convex]] [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedral]] cells.

Twenty-eight such honeycombs are known:
* the familiar [[cubic honeycomb]] and 7 truncations thereof;
* the [[alternated cubic honeycomb]] and 4 truncations thereof;
* 10 prismatic forms based on the [[#Prismatic_stacks|uniform plane tilings]] (11 if including the cubic honeycomb);
* 5 modifications of some of the above by elongation and/or gyration.

They can be considered the three-dimensional analogue to the [[List of uniform planar tilings|uniform tilings of the plane]].

The [[Voronoi diagram]] of any [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] forms a convex uniform honeycomb in which the cells are [[zonohedra]].

== History ==
* '''1900''': [[Thorold Gosset]] enumerated the list of semiregular convex polytopes with regular cells ([[Platonic solid]]s) in his publication ''On the Regular and Semi-Regular Figures in Space of n Dimensions'', including one regular cubic honeycomb, and two semiregular forms with tetrahedra and octahedra.
* '''1905''': [[Alfredo Andreini]] enumerated 25 of these tessellations.
* '''1991''': [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]]'s manuscript ''Uniform Polytopes'' identified the list of 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A242941|title=A242941 - OEIS|website=oeis.org|access-date=2019-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1994''': [[Branko Grünbaum]], in his paper ''Uniform tilings of 3-space'', also independently enumerated all 28, after discovering errors in Andreini's publication. He found the 1905 paper, which listed 25, had 1 wrong, and [[Convex uniform honeycomb#Nonwythoffian forms (gyrated and elongated)|4 being missing]]. Grünbaum states in this paper that Norman Johnson deserves priority for achieving the same enumeration in 1991. He also mentions that [[I. Alexeyev]] of Russia had contacted him regarding a putative enumeration of these forms, but that Grünbaum was unable to verify this at the time.
* '''2006''': George Olshevsky, in his manuscript ''Uniform Panoploid Tetracombs'', along with repeating the derived list of 11 convex uniform tilings, and 28 convex uniform honeycombs, expands a further derived list of 143 convex uniform tetracombs (Honeycombs of [[uniform 4-polytope]]s in 4-space).&lt;ref&gt;George Olshevsky, (2006, ''Uniform Panoploid Tetracombs'', Manuscript ''(Complete list of 11 convex uniform tilings, 28 convex uniform honeycombs, and 143 convex uniform tetracombs)'' [http://bendwavy.org/4HONEYS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 14 of the convex uniform polyhedra appear in these patterns:
* three of the five [[Platonic solid]]s,
* six of the thirteen [[Archimedean solid]]s, and
* five of the infinite family of [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s.

=== Names ===
This set can be called the '''regular and semiregular honeycombs'''. It has been called the '''Archimedean honeycombs''' by analogy with the convex uniform (non-regular) polyhedra, commonly called [[Archimedean solid]]s. Recently [[John Horton Conway|Conway]] has suggested naming the set as the '''Architectonic tessellations''' and the dual honeycombs as the '''[[Catoptric tessellation]]s'''.

The individual honeycombs are listed with names given to them by [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]]. (Some of the terms used below are defined in [[Uniform 4-polytope#Geometric derivations for 46 nonprismatic Wythoffian uniform 4-polytopes]])

For cross-referencing, they are given with list indices from '''A'''ndreini (1-22), '''W'''illiams(1-2,9-19), '''J'''ohnson (11-19, 21–25, 31–34, 41–49, 51–52, 61-65), and '''G'''rünbaum(1-28). Coxeter uses &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for a [[cubic honeycomb]], h&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for an [[alternated cubic honeycomb]], q&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for a [[quarter cubic honeycomb]], with subscripts for other forms based on the ring patterns of the Coxeter diagram.

== Compact Euclidean uniform tessellations (by their infinite Coxeter group families) ==
[[File:Coxeter-Dynkin 3-space groups.png|380px|thumb|Fundamental domains in a cubic element of three groups.]]
[[File:Coxeter diagram affine rank4 correspondence.png|380px|thumb|Family correspondences]]
The fundamental infinite [[Coxeter group]]s for 3-space are:
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{C}}_3&lt;/math&gt;, [4,3,4], cubic, {{CDD|node|4|node|3|node|4|node}} (8 unique forms plus one alternation)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{B}}_3&lt;/math&gt;, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;], alternated cubic, {{CDD|nodes|split2|node|4|node}} (11 forms, 3 new)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_3&lt;/math&gt; cyclic group, [(3,3,3,3)] or [3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|branch|3ab|branch}} (5 forms, one new)

There is a correspondence between all three families. Removing one mirror from &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{C}}_3&lt;/math&gt; produces &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{B}}_3&lt;/math&gt;, and removing one mirror from &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{B}}_3&lt;/math&gt; produces &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_3&lt;/math&gt;. This allows multiple constructions of the same honeycombs. If cells are colored based on unique positions within each Wythoff construction, these different symmetries can be shown.

In addition there are 5 special honeycombs which don't have pure reflectional symmetry and are constructed from reflectional forms with ''elongation'' and ''gyration'' operations.

The total unique honeycombs above are 18.

The prismatic stacks from infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{C}}_2&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;, [4,4,2,∞] prismatic group, {{CDD|node|4|node|4|node|2|node|infin|node}} (2 new forms)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{H}}_2&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;, [6,3,2,∞] prismatic group, {{CDD|node|6|node|3|node|2|node|infin|node}} (7 unique forms)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_2&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;, [(3,3,3),2,∞] prismatic group, {{CDD|node|split1|branch|2|node|infin|node}} (No new forms)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;, [∞,2,∞,2,∞] prismatic group, {{CDD|node|infin|node|2|node|infin|node|2|node|infin|node}} (These all become a ''cubic honeycomb'')

In addition there is one special ''elongated'' form of the triangular prismatic honeycomb.

The total unique prismatic honeycombs above (excluding the cubic counted previously) are 10.

Combining these counts, 18 and 10 gives us the total 28 uniform honeycombs.

=== The C&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [4,3,4] group (cubic) ===
The regular cubic honeycomb, represented by Schläfli symbol {4,3,4}, offers seven unique derived uniform honeycombs via truncation operations. (One redundant form, the ''runcinated cubic honeycomb'', is included for completeness though identical to the cubic honeycomb.) The reflectional symmetry is the affine [[Coxeter group]] [4,3,4]. There are four index 2 subgroups that generate alternations: [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3,4], [(4,3,4,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)], [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], and [4,3,4]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with the first two generated repeated forms, and the last two are nonuniform.

=== B&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] group ===

The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{B}}_3&lt;/math&gt;, [4,3] group offers 11 derived forms via truncation operations, four being unique uniform honeycombs. There are 3 index 2 subgroups that generate alternations: [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;], [4,(3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and [4,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The first generates repeated honeycomb, and the last two are nonuniform but included for completeness.

The honeycombs from this group are called ''alternated cubic'' because the first form can be seen as a ''cubic honeycomb'' with alternate vertices removed, reducing cubic cells to tetrahedra and creating octahedron cells in the gaps.

Nodes are indexed left to right as ''0,1,0',3'' with 0' being below and interchangeable with ''0''. The ''alternate cubic'' names given are based on this ordering.

=== Nonwythoffian forms (gyrated and elongated) ===
Three more uniform honeycombs are generated by breaking one or another of the above honeycombs where its faces form a continuous plane, then rotating alternate layers by 60 or 90 degrees (''gyration'') and/or inserting a layer of prisms (''elongation'').

The elongated and gyroelongated alternated cubic tilings have the same vertex figure, but are not alike.  In the ''elongated'' form, each prism meets a tetrahedron at one triangular end and an octahedron at the other.  In the ''gyroelongated'' form, prisms that meet tetrahedra at both ends alternate with prisms that meet octahedra at both ends.

The gyroelongated triangular prismatic tiling has the same vertex figure as one of the plain prismatic tilings; the two may be derived from the gyrated and plain triangular prismatic tilings, respectively, by inserting layers of cubes.

=== Prismatic stacks ===
Eleven '''prismatic''' tilings are obtained by stacking the eleven [[tiling by regular polygons|uniform plane tilings]], shown below, in parallel layers.  (One of these honeycombs is the cubic, shown above.)  The [[vertex figure]] of each is an irregular [[bipyramid]] whose faces are [[isosceles triangle]]s.

There are only 3 unique honeycombs from the square tiling, but all 6 tiling truncations are listed below for completeness, and tiling images are shown by colors corresponding to each form.

The [[tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb|alternated cubic honeycomb]] is of special importance since its vertices form a cubic [[close-packing]] of spheres. The space-filling [[truss]] of packed octahedra and tetrahedra was apparently first discovered by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and independently re-discovered by [[Buckminster Fuller]] (who called it the [[octet truss]] and patented it in the 1940s).

== Scaliform honeycomb==
A '''[[scaliform polytope|scaliform]] honeycomb''' is [[vertex-transitive]], like a ''uniform honeycomb'', with regular polygon faces while cells and higher elements are only required to be ''orbiforms'', equilateral, with their vertices lying on hyperspheres. For 3D honeycombs, this allows a subset of [[Johnson solid]]s along with the uniform polyhedra. Some scaliforms can be generated by an alternation process, leaving, for example, [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] and [[cupola (geometry)|cupola]] gaps.&lt;ref&gt;http://bendwavy.org/klitzing/explain/polytope-tree.htm#scaliform&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic space}}

There are 9 [[Coxeter group]] families of compact uniform honeycombs in [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]], generated as [[Wythoff construction]]s, and represented by ring permutations of the [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]s for each family.

From these 9 families, there are a total of 76 unique honeycombs generated:
* [3,5,3] : {{CDD|node|3|node|5|node|3|node}} - 9 forms
* [5,3,4] : {{CDD|node|5|node|3|node|4|node}} - 15 forms

The full list of hyperbolic uniform honeycombs has not been proven and an unknown number of [[non-Wythoffian]] forms exist. One known example is in the {3,5,3} family.

=== Paracompact hyperbolic forms ===
{{main|Paracompact uniform honeycombs}}
There are also 23 paracompact Coxeter groups of rank 4. These families can produce uniform honeycombs with unbounded facets or vertex figure, including ideal vertices at infinity:

'''Assassination''' is the murder of a prominent person, usually for political, religious, or monetary reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary &quot;the act of deliberately killing someone especially a public figure, usually for hire or for political reasons&quot; (''Legal Research, Analysis and Writing'' by William H. Putman [https://books.google.com/books?id=M0nlVU6M26AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 215] and [http://hir.harvard.edu/leadership/on-the-offensive Assassination Policy Under International Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206230433/http://hir.harvard.edu/leadership/on-the-offensive |date=December 6, 2010 }}, Harvard International Review, May 6, 2006 by Kristen Eichensehr).&lt;/ref&gt;

An assassination may be prompted by religious, political or military [[Motive (law)|motives]]. It is an act that may be done for [[contract killing|financial gain]], to [[revenge|avenge]] a [[grievance]], from a desire to acquire [[celebrity|fame]] or [[infamy|notoriety]], or because of a military, security, insurgent or [[secret police]] group's command to carry out the [[homicide]]. Acts of assassination have been performed since [[Ancient history|ancient times]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Hashshashin}}
[[File:Assassination of Nizam al-Mulk.jpg|thumb|260px|left|14th-century painting of the successful assassination of [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the ''de facto'' ruler of the [[Seljuq Empire]], by an Assassin.]]
The word ''assassin'' is often believed to derive from the word ''[[hashshashin]]'' (Arabic: حشّاشين, ħashshāshīyīn, also hashishin, hashashiyyin, or assassins),&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' – McCarthy, Kevin M. Volume 48, pp. 77–83&lt;/ref&gt;  and shares its etymological roots with ''[[hashish]]'' ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|ˈ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}}; from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|حشيش}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḥashīsh}}'').&lt;ref name=&quot;The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam&quot;&gt;''The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam'' – Bernard Lewis, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to a group of [[Nizari|Nizari Ismailis]] known as [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] who worked against various political targets.

Founded by [[Hassan-i Sabbah]], the Assassins were active in the fortress of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] in Persia from the 8th to the 14th centuries, and later expanded by capturing forts in Syria. The group killed members of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]], and Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] elite for political and religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Altair Cassell Illustrated, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-84403-416-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of [[hashish]] during their killings or during their indoctrination, there is debate as to whether these claims have merit, with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name.&lt;ref name=&quot;C:AH&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cannabis:+A+History#v=onepage&amp;q=hashishiyya&amp;f=false | author= Martin Booth | title= Cannabis: A History |year= 2004 | publisher= Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-42494-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known use of the verb &quot;to assassinate&quot; in printed English was by [[Matthew Sutcliffe]] in ''A Briefe Replie to a Certaine Odious and Slanderous Libel, Lately Published by a Seditious Jesuite'', a pamphlet printed in 1600, five years before it was used in ''[[Macbeth]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (1605).&lt;ref&gt;''A briefe replie to a certaine odious and slanderous libel, lately published by a seditious Iesuite.'' Imprinted at London : By Arn. Hatfield, 1600 (STC 23453) p.103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;assassinate, v.&quot; OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2016. Web. August 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient to medieval times===
[[File:Giaele e Sisara.JPG|thumbnail|right|''Jael and Sisera'', by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]].]]
Assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]].  It dates back at least as far as recorded history.

In the [[Old Testament]], King [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] was assassinated by his own servants;&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings 12:19-21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joab]] assassinated [[Absalom]], [[King David]]'s son;&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 3:26-28 RSV&lt;/ref&gt; and King [[Sennacherib]] of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons.&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 32:21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chanakya]] (c. 350–283 BC) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise ''[[Arthashastra]]''. His student [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies, including two of [[Alexander the Great]]'s generals, [[Nicanor (satrap)|Nicanor]] and [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink = Roger Boesche | first = Roger | last = Boesche |date=January 2003 | title = Kautilya's ''Arthaśāstra'' on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India | journal = The Journal of Military History | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–37 | doi = 10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/journal_of_military_history/v067/67.1boesche.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous victims are [[Philip II of Macedon]] (336&amp;nbsp;BC), the father of Alexander the Great, and Roman dictator [[Julius Caesar]] (44&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kloWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=famous+assassinations#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Famous assassinations of history&amp;nbsp;... |date=March 3, 2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2010|last1=Johnson|first1=Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperors of Rome]] often met their end in this way, as did many of the Muslim [[Shia Imam]]s hundreds of years later. The practice was also well known in ancient China, as in [[Jing Ke]]'s failed assassination of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] king [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]] in 227&amp;nbsp;BC. Whilst many assassinations were performed by individuals or small groups, there were also specialized units who used a collective group of people to perform more than one assassination. The earliest were the [[sicarii]] in 6 AD, who predated the Middle Eastern [[Order of Assassins|assassins]] and Japanese [[shinobi]]s by centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Pichtel, John, ''Terrorism and WMDs: Awareness and Response'', CRC Press (April 25, 2011) p.3-4. {{ISBN|978-1439851753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross&quot;&gt;Ross, Jeffrey Ian, ''Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present'', Routledge (January 15, 2011), Chapter: Sicarii. 978-0765620484&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[regicide]] was rare in Western Europe, but it was a recurring theme in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].  Strangling in the bathtub was the most commonly used method. With the [[Renaissance]], [[tyrannicide]]—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe. High medieval sources mention the assassination of King [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] (1089), dying at the hands of his own people, who objected to a proposition by the pope to go on a campaign to aid the [[Byzantine]]s against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks. This account is, however, contentious among historians, it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes. The myth of the &quot;Curse of King Zvonimir&quot; is based on the legend of his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffzg.hr/pov/pov2/files/3zavod/radovi38/nemet38.pdf |title=FFZG.hr |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1192, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], the ''[[de facto]]'' [[King of Jerusalem]], was killed by an [[Order of Assassins|assassin]].

The reigns of King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland (1296), [[William the Silent]] of the Netherlands (1584), and the French kings [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1589) and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1610) were all ended by assassins.

===Modern history===
In the modern world, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the [[propaganda of the deed]]. In [[Russian Empire|Russia]] alone, two emperors, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and his grandson [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], were assassinated within 80 years. In the [[United Kingdom]], only one [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] has been [[Assassination of Spencer Perceval|assassinated]]—[[Spencer Perceval]] on May 11, 1812.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillen&quot;&gt;M. Gillen 1972 ''Assassination of the Prime Minister: the shocking death of Spencer Perceval''. London: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson {{ISBN|0-283-97881-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, a group of assassins called the [[Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu]] killed a number of people, including [[Ii Naosuke]] who was the head of administration for the Tokugawa shogunate, during the [[Boshin War]].&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen. ''The Samurai Swordsman: Master of War''. Tuttle Publishing; 1 edition (August 5, 2014). p. 182. {{ISBN|978-4805312940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the assassinations in Japan were committed with bladed weaponry, a trait that was carried on into modern history.  A video-record exists of the assassination of [[Inejiro Asanuma]],  using a sword.&lt;ref name=chun&gt;{{cite book |title=A Nation of a Hundred Million Idiots?: A Social History of Japanese Television, 1953–1973 |last=Chun |first=Jayson Makoto |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9miRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184 |pages=184–185 |isbn=978-0-415-97660-2 |accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, within 100 years, four presidents—[[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]], [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|James A. Garfield]], [[Assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley]] and [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]]—died at the hands of assassins. There have been at least [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts|20 known attempts]] on U.S. presidents' lives. [[Huey Long]], a Senator, was assassinated on September 10, 1935. [[Robert F. Kennedy]], a Senator and a presidential candidate, was also [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on June 6, 1968 in the United States.

In Austria, the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]] in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, carried out by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Serbian national and a member of the [[Serbia]]n nationalist [[Insurgency|insurgents]] ([[Black Hand (Serbia)|The Black Hand]]), is blamed for igniting [[World War I]] after a succession of minor conflicts, while belligerents on both sides in [[World War II]] used operatives specifically trained for assassination. [[Reinhard Heydrich]] died after an attack by British-trained Czechoslovak soldiers on behalf of the Czechoslovak government in exile in [[Operation Anthropoid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/images/id_7001_8000/7419/assassination-en.pdf |title=Assassination&amp;nbsp;— Operation Arthropoid, 1941–1942 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 |last=Burian |first=Michal |author2=Aleš |year=2002 |publisher=Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knowledge from decoded transmissions allowed the United States to carry out [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|a targeted attack]], killing Japanese [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] while he was travelling by plane. The Polish [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] conducted a regular [[Operation Heads|campaign of assassinations]] against top Nazi German officials in occupied Poland. [[Adolf Hitler]] was almost [[July 20 Plot|killed by his own officers]], and survived various attempts by other persons and organizations (such as [[Operation Foxley]], though this plan was never put into practice).

During the 1930s and 1940s, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[NKVD]] carried out numerous assassinations outside of the Soviet Union, such as the killings of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] leader [[Yevhen Konovalets]], [[Ignace Poretsky]], [[Fourth International]] secretary Rudolf Klement, [[Leon Trotsky]], and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) leadership in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ellman.

India's &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;, [[Mahatma Gandhi]], was [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|shot to death]] on January 30, 1948 by [[Nathuram Godse]].

The African-American civil rights activist, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel (now the [[National Civil Rights Museum]]) in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Three years prior, another African-American civil rights activist, [[Malcolm X]], was assassinated at the [[Audubon Ballroom]] on February 21, 1965. Two years prior, another African-American civil rights activist, [[Medgar Evers]], was assassinated on June 12, 1963. [[Fred Hampton]] of the [[Black Panther Party]] was assassinated on December 4, 1969.

[[Liaquat Ali Khan]], the first [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], was assassinated by [[Saad Akbar]], a lone assassin, in 1951. Conspiracy theorists believe his conflict with certain members of the Pakistani military (Rawalpindi conspiracy) or suppression of Communists and antagonism towards the [[Soviet Union]], were potential reasons for his assassination.

In 1960, [[Inejiro Asanuma]], Chairman of the [[Japan Socialist Party|Japanese Socialist Party]], was assassinated in a stabbing by an extreme rightist.

The U.S. Senate Select Committee chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]] (the [[Church Committee]]) reported in 1975 that it had found &quot;concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro from 1960 to 1965.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0043a.htm Church Committee – Interim Report: Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders Part III.B, page 71] from the 'history-matters.com' website. Retrieved August 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major powers repudiated Cold War assassination tactics, though many allege that this was merely a smokescreen for political benefit and that covert and illegal training of assassins continues today, with Russia, [[Israel]], the U.S., [[Argentina]], Paraguay, [[Chile]], and other nations accused of engaging in such operations.&lt;ref&gt;John Dingles (2004) The Condor Years {{ISBN|978-1-56584-764-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] (who survived an assassination attempt himself) ordered the [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]] air raid on [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2012)|Libya]] in which one of the primary targets was the home residence of Libyan ruler [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. Gaddafi escaped unharmed; however, his adopted daughter [[Bombing of Libya (April 1986)#Casualties|Hanna]] was claimed to be one of the civilian casualties.

In the [[History of the Philippines (1965–1986)#The Fourth Republic (1981–1986)|Philippines]], the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] triggered the eventual downfall of the 20-year autocratic rule of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Aquino, a former [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] and a leading figure of the political opposition, was assassinated in 1983 at the [[Manila]] [[International Airport]] (now the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]) upon returning home from [[exile]].

After the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, the new Islamic government of Iran began an international campaign of assassination that lasted into the 1990s.

[[Anwar Sadat]], President of the Arab Republic of Egypt (formerly President of the United Arab Republic), was assassinated October 6, 1981, during the annual parade celebrating [[Operation Badr (1973)|Operation Badr]], the opening maneuver of the [[Yom Kippur War]].

Swedish prime minister [[Olof Palme]] was murdered by a gun-wielding man close to midnight on February 28, 1986, after having visited a cinema with his wife. The couple were not accompanied by a body guard detail. The identity of the assassin and the reason for the murder are still unknown.

In India, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Ministers]] [[Indira Gandhi]] and her son [[Rajiv Gandhi]] (neither of whom were related to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who was assassinated in 1948), were assassinated in 1984 and 1991 respectively. The assassinations were linked to [[Separatism|separatist]] movements in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and northern [[Sri Lanka]], respectively.

In [[Israel]], Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] was assassinated on November 4, 1995. [[Yigal Amir]] confessed and was convicted of the crime.

Israeli tourist minister [[Rehavam Ze'evi]] was assassinated on October 17, 2001, by [[Hamdi Quran]] and three other members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)]]. The PFLP stated that the assassination was in retaliation for the August 27, 2001, killing of [[Abu Ali Mustafa]], the Secretary General of the PFLP, by the [[Israeli Air Force]] under its policy of [[Israeli targeted killings|targeted killings]].

In [[Lebanon]], the assassination of former Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]] on February 14, 2005, prompted an investigation by the United Nations. The suggestion in the resulting ''[[Mehlis report]]'' that there was [[Syria]]n involvement, prompted the [[Cedar Revolution]], which drove Syrian troops out of Lebanon.

In [[Pakistan]], former prime minister and opposition leader [[Benazir Bhutto]] was [[Benazir Bhutto assassination|assassinated in 2007]], while running for re-election. Bhutto's assassination drew unanimous [[International reaction to the Benazir Bhutto assassination|condemnation from the international community]].&lt;ref&gt;''Benazir Bhutto shot dead at suicide bombing of rally; 20 feared dead'' – ''[[The Canadian Press]]'', Thursday December 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Guinea Bissau]], President [[João Bernardo Vieira]] was assassinated in the early hours of March 2, 2009, in the capital, [[Bissau]]. Unlike typical assassinations his death was not swift; he first survived an explosion at the Presidential Villa, was then shot and wounded, and was finally butchered with [[machete]]s. His assassination was carried out by renegade soldiers who were apparently avenging the death of General [[Tagme Na Waie]], the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Guinea Bissau, who was killed when a bomb exploded the day before.

===As a military and foreign policy doctrine===
{{See also|Manhunt (military)}}
[[File:Hokusai-sketches---hokusai-manga-vol6-crop.jpg|thumb|The functions of the [[ninja]] included [[espionage]], [[sabotage]] and assassination.]]

Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused – [[Sun Tzu]], writing around 500&amp;nbsp;BC, argued in favor of using assassination in his book ''[[The Art of War]]''. Nearly 2000 years later, in his book ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also advises rulers to assassinate enemies whenever possible so they won't pose a threat.&lt;ref&gt;Machiavelli, Niccolò (1985), The Prince, University of Chicago Press. Translated by Harvey Mansfield&lt;/ref&gt; An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a [[cult of personality|particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader]], whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war.

For similar and additional reasons, assassination has also sometimes been used in the conduct of [[foreign policy]].  The costs and benefits of such actions are difficult to compute, especially when they depend upon the policies of a successor, and one study has found that perceptual biases held by leaders often negatively affect decision making in this area, such that decisions made to go forward with assassinations often reflect the vague hope that any successor might be better.&lt;ref name=&quot;iraja&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Decision Making in Using Assassinations in International Relations | url=http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19545 | journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] | volume=131| issue=3 | date=Fall 2016 | pages= 503–539 | last=Schilling | first=Warner R. | authorlink=Warner R. Schilling | last2= Schilling | first2=Jonathan L. |doi = 10.1002/polq.12487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both military and foreign policy assassinations, there is the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader, or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will &quot;[[Martyr (politics)|martyr]]&quot; a leader and lead to greater support of his or her cause (by showing the ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. A number of additional examples from [[World War II]] show how assassination was used as a tool:

* The [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reinhard Heydrich]] in Prague on May 27, 1942 by the British and Czechoslovak government-in-exile.  This case illustrates the difficulty of comparing the benefits of a foreign policy goal (strengthening the legitimacy and influence of the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] in London) against the possible costs resulting from an assassination (the [[Lidice massacre]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;iraja&quot;/&gt;
* The American interception of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.
* [[Operation Gaff]] was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as &quot;The Desert Fox&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Skor&quot;&gt;''Commando Extraordinary'' – Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:
* During the [[Vietnam War]], partly in response to [[Viet Cong]] assassinations of government leaders, the U.S. engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] in order to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and it killed between 6,000 and 41,000 people, with official 'targets' of 1,800 per month. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
* With the [[2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike|Baghdad International Airport airstrike]] the US assassinated the commander of Iran's [[Quds Force]] General [[Qasem Soleimani]] and the commander of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]] along with 8 other high-ranking military personnel. The assassination of these military leaders was part of [[2019–20 Persian Gulf crisis|escalating tensions between the US and Iran]] and the [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|American-led intervention in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Qassem Suleimani: 'Death to America' chants at Baghdad funeral procession | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/huge-crowds-expected-in-baghdad-for-funeral-of-iranian-general-killed-by-us | first=Ghait|last=Abdul-Ahat|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date= January 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Iran Says It Has Decided How to React to U.S. Strike That Killed Soleimani | url=https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/four-rockets-hit-military-base-near-baghdad-airport-report-says-1.8350357 | first=Amos|last=Harel|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date= January 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a tool of insurgents===
Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.

The [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919–21 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit – [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] – for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.

This tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969–1998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|Unionist]] politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing the Conservative Party Conference]] in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.

[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably the President of the Government of Spain [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.

The [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.&lt;ref&gt;''Viet Cong'' – Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
A major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;/&gt;

However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;/&gt;

==Techniques==

===Modern methods===

With the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival since they could quickly flee the scene.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584. [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.

Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' – [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|Rifle of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]
[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|[[Derringer]] of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]
A [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain pragmatic difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austria&quot;&gt;''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542559/Iraqi-insurgents-using-Austrian-rifles-from-Iran.html Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' – [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;/&gt;

In the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the USSR, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella]. [[BBC]] World Service, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CIA]] made several [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro]], many of the schemes involving poisoning his cigars. In the late 1950s, KGB assassin [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] killed Ukrainian nationalist leaders [[Lev Rebet]] and [[Stepan Bandera]] with a spray gun that fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed [[cyanide]] ampule, making their deaths look like heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]].

[[Basic Books]], 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00312-9}} p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 case in the UK concerned the [[Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko|assassination of Alexander Litvinenko]] who was given a lethal dose of radioactive [[polonium]]-210, possibly passed to him in aerosol form sprayed directly onto his food.

Shortly before his death he issued a statement accusing [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] of involvement in his assassination. President Putin denies he had any part in Litvinenko's death.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20082851241951 Putin 'Deplores' Spy Death]'' – [[Sky News]] Friday November 24, 2006 {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targeted killing==
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
[[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|[[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]; sometimes used in targeted killings]]
Targeted killing is the intentional killing–by a government or its agents–of a civilian or &quot;[[unlawful combatant]]&quot; who is not in the government's custody.  The target is a person asserted to be taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the [[Third Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt; Note that this is a different term and concept from that of &quot;targeted violence&quot; as used by specialists who study violence.

On the other hand, [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law]] Professor [[Gary D. Solis|Gary Solis]], in his 2010 book entitled ''The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6FKf0ocxEPAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Law+of+Armed+Conflict:+International+Humanitarian+Law+in+War#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The law of armed conflict&amp;nbsp;... – Gary D.

Sofaer|Abraham Sofaer]], former federal judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], wrote on the subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When people call a targeted killing an &quot;assassination,&quot; they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States&amp;nbsp;... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests&amp;nbsp;... But killings in self-defense are no more &quot;assassinations&quot; in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan has argued that &quot;there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing&amp;nbsp;... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination.

On the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union also states on its website, &quot;A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/frequently-asked-questions-about-targeting-killing |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Targeting Killing &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article &quot;By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Yael |title=By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to &quot;Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing&quot; |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120314201721/http%3A//www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860%2Ehtml |website=Carnegie Council |accessdate=31 January 2019 |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Targeted killing has become a frequent tactic of the [[United States]] and [[Israel]] in their fight against terrorism.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6FKf0ocxEPAC&amp;pg=PA542&amp;dq=%22targeted+killing%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22targeted%20killing%22&amp;f=false |title=The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War|author= Gary D.

==Counter-measures==

===Early forms===
[[File:Sattar Bodyguard.JPG|thumb|left|upright=.5|This bodyguard was killed by an [[improvised explosive device|IED]] during [[Abdul Sattar Abu Risha#Death|Sheik Abdul Sattar Abu Risha's assassination]] in 2007]]
One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins was employing [[bodyguard]]s. Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way—both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target,&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;&gt;''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620171200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf |date=June 20, 2006 }}'' – Fein, Robert A. &amp; Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.

Notable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]—though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).

Another notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.

===Modern strategies===
[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored cars or limousines]] were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire, smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103071805/http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php |date=January 3, 2007 }}'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected  – so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted;&lt;ref name=&quot;Report&quot;&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detectors]].

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]].

[[File:Popemobil Mai 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a modified [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[Popemobile]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil]]
The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[MRAP]]-like [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Report&quot;/&gt;

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], and in some cases [[plastic surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations.  According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, [[Fidel Castro]] used body doubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOX&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |title=It's Bin Laden&amp;nbsp;... or Is It? |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=December 20, 2001 |first=Catherine |last=Donaldson-Evans |access-date=December 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805130250/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of alcohol dependence begins at low levels of drinking and increases directly with both the volume of alcohol consumed and a pattern of [[Binge drinking|drinking larger amounts on an occasion]], to the point of intoxication, which is sometimes called &quot;binge drinking&quot;. Young adults are particularly at risk of engaging in binge drinking.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Long-term misuse===
[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Some of the possible [[long-term effects of ethanol]] an individual may develop. Additionally, in pregnant women, alcohol can cause [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].]]
Alcoholism is characterised by an increased [[Alcohol tolerance|tolerance]] to alcohol&amp;nbsp;– which means that an individual can consume more alcohol&amp;nbsp;– and [[physical dependence]] on alcohol, which makes it hard for an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role in decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman-1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffman |first=PL |last2=Tabakoff |first2=B | title = Alcohol dependence: a commentary on mechanisms | journal = Alcohol and Alcoholism | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–40 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8879279 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.alcalc.a008159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide.

=== Warning signs ===
Warning signs of alcoholism include the consumption of increasing amounts of alcohol and frequent intoxication, preoccupation with drinking to the exclusion of other activities, promises to quit drinking and failure to keep those promises, the inability to remember what was said or done while drinking (colloquially known as &quot;blackouts&quot;), personality changes associated with drinking, denial or the making of excuses for drinking, the refusal to admit excessive drinking, dysfunction or other problems at work or school, the loss of interest in personal appearance or hygiene, marital and economic problems, and the complaint of poor health, with loss of appetite, respiratory infections, or increased anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Volume Library|publisher=The Southwestern Company|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RE9OwGtvDMACf}}|year=2009|isbn=978-0-87197-208-8|volume=1|location=Nashville, TN |page=29|chapter=Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Short-term effects=====
{{Main|Short-term effects of alcohol consumption}}

Drinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03–0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]] (a &quot;happy&quot; feeling), increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC of 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious) and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. With all alcoholic beverages, [[drinking and driving|drinking while driving]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties for drunk driving.

An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment while drunk can profoundly affect those surrounding him and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to [[relational disorder|marital conflict]] and [[divorce]], or contribute to [[domestic violence]]. Alcoholism can also lead to [[child neglect]], with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcemh2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Schadé |first1=Johannes Petrus |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Medicine and Health |year=2006 |publisher=Foreign Media Books |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=j8DuEHxSCU4C|page=132}} |isbn=978-1-60136-001-4 |pages=132–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems.

With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence]]. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled [[synapse]] firing. This can result in symptoms that include [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], life-threatening [[seizure]]s, [[delirium tremens]], hallucinations, shakes and possible [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medical toxicology&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dart |first1=Richard C. |title=Medical Toxicology |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=qDf3AO8nILoC|page=139}} |edition=3rd |year=2003 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location= |isbn=978-0-7817-2845-4 |pages=139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Idemudia |first1=SO |last2=Bhadra |first2=S |last3=Lal |first3=H | title = The pentylenetetrazol-like interoceptive stimulus produced by ethanol withdrawal is potentiated by bicuculline and picrotoxinin | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–22 | date = June 1989 | pmid = 2742726 | doi = 10.1016/0893-133X(89)90014-6 | url = | type = | issn = 0893-133X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially [[dopamine]], [[NMDA]] and [[glutamate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman-1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Chastain |first1=G | title = Alcohol, neurotransmitter systems, and behavior | journal = The Journal of General Psychology | volume = 133 | issue = 4 | pages = 329–35 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17128954 | doi = 10.3200/GENP.133.4.329-335 | issn = 0022-1309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe acute withdrawal symptoms such as [[delirium tremens]] and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase can be defined as lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20148778&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heilig |first1=M |last2=Egli |first2=M |last3=Crabbe |first3=JC |last4=Becker |first4=HC | title = Acute withdrawal, protracted abstinence and negative affect in alcoholism: are they linked? | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–84 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20148778 | pmc = 3268458 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2009.00194.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the [[post-acute withdrawal syndrome]]; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years.

A [[Kindling (sedative-hypnotic withdrawal)|kindling effect]] also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Breese-2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breese |first1=GR |last2=Sinha |first2=R |last3=Heilig |first3=M | title = Chronic alcohol neuroadaptation and stress contribute to susceptibility for alcohol craving and relapse | journal = Pharmacol Ther | volume = 129 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–71 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20951730 | pmc = 3026093 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20148778&quot; /&gt; There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal.

===Gender difference===
Based on combined data from [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|SAMHSA]]'s 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use &amp; Health, the rate of past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% of those who did not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gender differences in alcohol use and alcohol dependence or abuse: 2004 or 2005.&quot; The NSDUH Report.

According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 [[standard drink]]s per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day.

====Alcoholism====
The term ''alcoholism'' is commonly used amongst laypeople, but the word is poorly defined. The WHO calls ''alcoholism'' &quot;a term of long-standing use and variable meaning&quot;, and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO expert committee. ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'' (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic (but others note that many do recover), but does not define what is meant by the term ''alcoholic'' in this context. In 1960, [[Bill W.]], co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), said:
:We have never called alcoholism a [[disease]] because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as [[heart disease]]. Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. We did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. We always called it an [[illness]], or a [[malady]]&amp;nbsp;– a far safer term for us to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGovernWhite2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Thomas F.|last1= McGovern|first2=William L. |last2=White|title=Alcohol Problems in the United States: Twenty Years of Treatment Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3gRwmYohuooC|page=7}}|accessdate=17 April 2010|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7890-2049-9|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In professional and research contexts, the term &quot;alcoholism&quot; sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000002709|alcoholism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence. Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.&lt;ref name=Thomb1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introduction To Addictive Behaviors 2ed|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Aze4azm9XkQCIntroduction}}|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict's response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered &quot;normal&quot; drinking and the last two are viewed as &quot;typical&quot; alcoholic drinking.&lt;ref name=Thomb1999/&gt; Johnson's four phases consist of:
# Learning the mood swing. A person is introduced to alcohol (in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age), and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces.  At this stage, there is no emotional cost.
# Seeking the mood swing. A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1; the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect. Again at this stage, there are no significant consequences.
# At the third stage there are physical and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink excessively, disregarding the problems.
# The fourth stage can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.&lt;ref name=Thomb1999/&gt;

====Milam &amp; Ketcham's physical deterioration stages====
Other theorists such as Milam &amp; Ketcham (1983) focus on the physical deterioration that alcohol consumption causes. They describe the process in three stages:
# Adaptive stage – The person will not experience any negative symptoms, and they believe they have the capacity for drinking alcohol without problems. Physiological changes are happening with the increase in tolerance, but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others.
# Dependent stage – At this stage, symptoms build up gradually. [[Hangover]] symptoms from excessive drinking may be confused with withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their drinking problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.
# Deterioration stage – Various organs are damaged due to long-term drinking. Medical treatment in a rehabilitation center will be required; otherwise, the pathological changes will cause death.

====DSM and ICD====
In psychology and psychiatry, the DSM is the most common global standard, while in medicine, the standard is ICD. The terms they recommend are similar but not identical.

The [[DSM-IV]] diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents one approach to the definition of alcoholism. In part, this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared to one another. According to the DSM-IV, an alcohol dependence diagnosis is: &quot;maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one-year period: tolerance; withdrawal; taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended; desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use; great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from use; social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced; continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological [[sequela]]e.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSMIV&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=W-BGAAAAMAAJ}} |year = 1994 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6 | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the imprecision inherent in the term, there have been attempts to define how the word ''alcoholism'' should be interpreted when encountered. In 1992, it was defined by the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]] (NCADD) and [[American Society of Addiction Medicine|ASAM]] as &quot;a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morse |first1=RM |last2=Flavin |first2=DK | title = The definition of alcoholism.

===Social barriers===
Attitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This is more of a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870&quot; &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = Laura N. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = Nancy H. | last3 = Riggs | first3 = Joseph A. | last4 = Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association | author-link4 = American Medical Association | title = Alcoholism and alcohol abuse among women: report of the council on scientific affairs | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–70 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.861 | pmid = 9785312 | date = September 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356&quot; /&gt;

Screening is recommended among those over the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=US Preventive Services Task |first1=Force. |last2=Curry |first2=SJ |last3=Krist |first3=AH |last4=Owens |first4=DK |last5=Barry |first5=MJ |last6=Caughey |first6=AB |last7=Davidson |first7=KW |last8=Doubeni |first8=CA |last9=Epling JW |first9=Jr |last10=Kemper |first10=AR |last11=Kubik |first11=M |last12=Landefeld |first12=CS |last13=Mangione |first13=CM |last14=Silverstein |first14=M |last15=Simon |first15=MA |last16=Tseng |first16=CW |last17=Wong |first17=JB |title=Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions to Reduce Unhealthy Alcohol Use in Adolescents and Adults: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement. |journal=JAMA |date=13 November 2018 |volume=320 |issue=18 |pages=1899–1909 |doi=10.1001/jama.2018.16789 |pmid=30422199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several tools may be used to detect a loss of control of alcohol use. These tools are mostly [[self report study|self-reports]] in questionnaire form. Another common theme is a score or tally that sums up the general severity of alcohol use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahan-1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last= Kahan |first=M | title = Identifying and managing problem drinkers | journal = Can Fam Physician | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 661–71 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8653034 | pmc = 2146411 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CAGE questionnaire]], named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.

{{Quotation|Two &quot;yes&quot; responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further.

The questionnaire asks the following questions:

# Have you ever felt you needed to '''C'''ut down on your drinking?
# Have people '''A'''nnoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
# Have you ever felt '''G'''uilty about drinking?
# Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning ('''E'''ye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ewing |first=JA |title=Detecting alcoholism.

Other tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence, such as the [[Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire]], which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the [[CAGE questionnaire]]. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index3556EN.html |title=Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire (SADD) |last1=Raistrick |first1=D. |last2=Dunbar|first2= G. |last3=Davidson |first3=R. |year=1983 |publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721101929/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index3556EN.html |archivedate=21 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Michigan Alcohol Screening Test]] (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncadd-sfv.org/symptoms/mast_test.html |title=Michigan Alcohol Screening Test |publisher=The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906123532/http://www.ncadd-sfv.org/symptoms/mast_test.html |archivedate=6 September 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[driving under the influence]] being the most common. The [[Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test]] (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the [[World Health Organization]], is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf |title=The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; Guidelines for Use in Primary Care |first1=Thomas F. |last1=Babor |first2=John C. |last2=Higgins-Biddle |first3=John B. |last3=Saunders |first4=Maristela G. |last4=Monteiro |year=2001 |publisher=World Health Organization |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502132711/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paddington Alcohol Test]] (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending [[Accident and Emergency department]]s. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith |first1=SG |last2=Touquet |first2=R |last3=Wright |first3=S |last4=Das Gupta |first4=N | title = Detection of alcohol misusing patients in accident and emergency departments: the Paddington alcohol test (PAT) | journal = Journal of Accident and Emergency Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 308–12 | date = September 1996 | pmid = 8894853 | pmc = 1342761 | doi = 10.1136/emj.13.5.308 | issn = 1351-0622 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

===Urine and blood tests===
There are reliable tests for the actual use of alcohol, one common test being that of [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Jones |first=AW | title = Urine as a biological specimen for forensic analysis of alcohol and variability in the urine-to-blood relationship | journal = Toxicol Rev | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–35 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16856767 | doi = 10.2165/00139709-200625010-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests do not differentiate alcoholics from non-alcoholics; however, long-term heavy drinking does have a few recognizable effects on the body, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=SK |last2= Dhanya |first2=L |last3=Vasudevan |first3=DM | title = Biomarkers of alcoholism: an updated review | journal = Scand J Clin Lab Invest | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–92 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17852805 | doi = 10.1080/00365510701532662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Macrocytosis]] (enlarged [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]])
* Elevated [[Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase|GGT]]
* Moderate elevation of [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] and [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and an AST: ALT ratio of 2:1
* High [[carbohydrate deficient transferrin]] (CDT)

With regard to alcoholism, BAC is useful to judge [[alcohol tolerance]], which in turn is a sign of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities including [[hypokalemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]], [[hyponatremia]], [[hyperuricemia]], [[metabolic acidosis]], and [[respiratory alkalosis]] are common in alcoholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIHHx&quot; /&gt;

However, none of these blood tests for biological markers is as sensitive as screening questionnaires.

==Prevention==
{{further|Alcohol education}}
The [[World Health Organization]], the [[European Union]] and other regional bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;alchwho2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/ |title=Alcohol |author=World Health Organization |year=2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226094205/http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/ |archivedate=26 February 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;apitwhoer&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/mediacentre/fs1005e.pdf |title=Alcohol policy in the WHO European Region: current status and the way forward |date=12 September 2005 |publisher=World Health Organization |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123105252/http://www.euro.who.int/document/mediacentre/fs1005e.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, [[evidence based]] educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.&lt;ref name=&quot;acdacpovfa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crews |first1=F |last2=He |first2=J |last3=Hodge |first3=C | title = Adolescent cortical development: a critical period of vulnerability for addiction | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–99 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17222895 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2006.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, some prefer a [[Harm reduction|harm-reduction]] approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabbard&quot;/&gt;

===Detoxification===
{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}
[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]]. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blondell-2005&quot;/&gt; Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20148778&quot; /&gt; Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavro-2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stavro |first1=K |last2=Pelletier |first2=J |last3=Potvin |first3=S | title = Widespread and sustained cognitive deficits in alcoholism: a meta-analysis | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–13 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22264351 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2011.00418.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===

Various forms of [[group therapy]] or [[psychotherapy]] can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan-Lopez-2006&quot;/&gt; [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest. Others include [[LifeRing Secular Recovery]], [[SMART Recovery]], [[Women for Sobriety]], and [[Secular Organizations for Sobriety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helpguide.org/articles/addiction/self-help-groups-for-alcohol-addiction.htm|title=Self-Help Groups for Alcohol Addiction|last=Smith, M.A.|first=Melinda|last2=Saisan, M.S.W.|first2=Joanna|date=2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521163926/http://www.helpguide.org/articles/addiction/self-help-groups-for-alcohol-addiction.htm|archivedate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholics Anonymous and [[twelve-step program]]s appear more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy or abstinence.&lt;ref name=coch2020&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12‐step programs for alcohol use disorder |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2020 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012880.pub2 |pmid=32159228 |vauthors=Kelly JF, Humphreys K, Ferri M |volume=3 |pages=CD012880 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moderate drinking===

Rationing and moderation programs such as [[Moderation Management]] and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking.

===Medications===
In the United States there are four approved medications for alcoholism: acamprosate, two methods of using naltrexone and disulfiram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Alcohol and Other Drugs|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA76/AA76.htm |url-status=live |publisher=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728134244/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa76/aa76.htm |archive-date=28 July 2013 |access-date=2013-07-11 |number=76|date=July 2008|journal=Alcohol Alert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Naltrexone]] is a [[competitive antagonist]] for opioid receptors, effectively blocking the effects of [[endorphin]]s and [[opioid]]s. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence in the body reduces the pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soyka |first1=M |last2=Rösner |first2=S | title = Opioid antagonists for pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence – a critical review | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 280–91 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19630726 | doi = 10.2174/1874473710801030280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol-dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking.&lt;ref name=JAMA2014/&gt; [[Nalmefene]] also appears effective and works in a similar manner.&lt;ref name=JAMA2014/&gt;

* [[Disulfiram]] prevents the elimination of [[acetaldehyde]], a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself is the cause of many [[hangover]] symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting, uncomfortable hangover.

Several other drugs are also used and many are under investigation.
* [[Benzodiazepines]], while useful in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=S.J.E. |editor1-last=Lindsay |editor2-first=Graham E. |editor2-last=Powell |title=The Handbook of Clinical Adult Psychology |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=a6A9AAAAIAAJ|page=380}} |edition=2nd |date=28 July 1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07215-1 |page=402 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting more than a quarter of people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics.

===Dual addictions and dependences===
Alcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic [[drug addiction]]s and [[drug dependence]]s. The most common dual dependence syndrome with alcohol dependence is [[benzodiazepine dependence]], with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepine drugs such as [[diazepam]] or [[clonazepam]]. These drugs are, like alcohol, [[depressant]]s. Benzodiazepines may be used legally, if they are prescribed by doctors for anxiety problems or other mood disorders, or they may be purchased as [[illegal drugs]].  Benzodiazepine use increases cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poulos |first1=CX |last2=Zack |first2=M | title = Low-dose diazepam primes motivation for alcohol and alcohol-related semantic networks in problem drinkers | journal = Behav Pharmacol | volume = 15 | issue = 7 | pages = 503–12 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15472572 | doi = 10.1097/00008877-200411000-00006 | url = | issn = 0955-8810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] and other health consequences. Dependence on other sedative-hypnotics such as [[zolpidem]] and [[zopiclone]] as well as [[opiate]]s and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics. Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics such as [[barbiturate]]s, benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]]s. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of [[psychosis]] or [[seizure]]s if not properly managed.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpdaa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johansson |first1=BA |last2=Berglund |first2=M |last3=Hanson |first3=M |last4=Pöhlén |first4=C |last5=Persson |first5=I | title = Dependence on legal psychotropic drugs among alcoholics | journal = Alcohol and Alcoholism | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 613–18 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14633651 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agg123 | url = http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/613 | format = PDF | issn = 0735-0414 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090220090248/http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/613 | archivedate = 20 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the medical and scientific communities, there is a broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that &quot;drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though, in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walter |first1=H|last2= Gutierrez |first2=K |last3=Ramskogler |first3=K|last4= Hertling |first4=I |last5=Dvorak |first5=A |last6=Lesch |first6=OM | title = Gender-specific differences in alcoholism: implications for treatment | journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 253–58 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14628177 | doi = 10.1007/s00737-003-0014-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dick |first1=DM |last2=Bierut |first2=LJ | title = The genetics of alcohol dependence | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–57 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16539893 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-006-0015-1 | url = | issn = 1523-3812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enoch-2006&quot;/&gt; 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse, while six percent are dependent on alcohol.

Alcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness boosted membership of the [[temperance movement]] and led to the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol in the United States]], a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages that remained in place until 1933; this policy resulted in the decline of death rates from cirrhosis and alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blocker2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blocker |first1=Jack S. |title=Did Prohibition Really Work?

The various health problems associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle accident]]s (due to [[drunk driving]]), [[domestic violence]], and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=McCully |first1=Chris |title=Goodbye Mr. Wonderful.

[[Stereotype]]s of alcoholics are often found in [[fiction]] and [[popular culture]]. The &quot;[[town drunk]]&quot; is a [[stock character]] in Western popular culture.

Caucasians have a much lower abstinence rate (11.8%) and much higher tolerance to symptoms (3.4±2.45 drinks) of alcohol than Chinese (33.4% and 2.2±1.78 drinks respectively).

==Research==
===Topiramate===
[[Topiramate]], a derivative of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, has been found effective in helping alcoholics quit or cut back on the amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olmsted |first1=CL |last2=Kockler |first2=DR | title = Topiramate for alcohol dependence | journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 1475–80 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18698008 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1L157 | issn = 1060-0280 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/212937c609f6ed0951bcce858807f46b47c2fbad }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kenna |first1=GA |last2=Lomastro |first2=TL |last3=Schiesl |first3=A |last4=Leggio |first4=L |last5=Swift |first5=RM | title = Review of topiramate: an antiepileptic for the treatment of alcohol dependence | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–42 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19630744 | doi = 10.2174/1874473710902020135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="36208" xml:space="preserve">{{about|the concept of abstraction in general|specific types of abstraction and other uses of the term|}}

'''Abstraction''' in its main sense is a conceptual process where general [[rule of inference|rules]] and [[concept]]s are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal (&quot;real&quot; or &quot;[[Abstract and concrete|concrete]]&quot;) signifiers, [[first principle]]s, or other methods.

&quot;An abstraction&quot; is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a ''group'', ''field'', or ''category''.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;[[Suzanne K. Langer]] (1953), ''Feeling and Form: a theory of art developed from Philosophy in a New Key'' p. 90: &quot;[[Sculpture|Sculptural form]] is a powerful abstraction from actual objects and the three-dimensional space which we construe ... through [[sensory system|touch and sight]].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the [[information]] content of a [[concept]] or an observable [[phenomenon]],  selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjectively valued purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a [[ball]] selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding, but not eliminating, the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball.&lt;ref name=Langer/&gt; In a [[type–token distinction]], a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').

Abstraction in its secondary use is a [[#Material process|material process]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Alfred Sohn-Rethel, ''Intellectual and manual labour: A critique of epistemology'', Humanities Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; discussed in the [[#Themes|themes below]].

==Origins==
Thinking in abstractions is considered by [[anthropologist]]s, [[archaeologist]]s, and [[sociologist]]s to be one of the key traits in [[modern human behaviour]], which is believed to have developed between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. Its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of human [[language]], which (whether spoken or written) appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking.

===History===
''Abstraction'' involves induction of ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something. It is the opposite of ''specification'', which is the analysis or breaking-down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete facts. Abstraction can be illustrated with [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620), a book of modern scientific philosophy written in the late [[Jacobean era]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesse&quot;&gt;Hesse, M. B. (1964), &quot;Francis Bacon's Philosophy of Science&quot;, in A Critical History of Western Philosophy, ed. D. J. O'Connor, New York, pp. 141–52.&lt;/ref&gt; of England to encourage modern thinkers to collect specific facts before making any generalizations.

Bacon used and promoted [[inductive reasoning|induction]] as an abstraction tool, and it countered the ancient [[deductive]]-thinking approach that had dominated the intellectual world since the times of Greek philosophers like [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Klein|first=Jürgen|title=Francis Bacon|date=2016|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/francis-bacon/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thales (c. 624–546 BCE) believed that everything in the universe comes from one main substance, water. He deduced or specified from a general idea, &quot;everything is water&quot;, to the specific forms of water such as ice, snow, fog, and rivers.

Modern scientists can also use the opposite approach of abstraction, or going from particular facts collected into one general idea, such as the motion of the planets ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]] (1642–1727)). When determining that the sun is the center of our solar system ([[Copernicus]] (1473–1543)), scientists  had to utilize thousands of measurements to finally conclude that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit about the sun ([[Kepler]] (1571–1630)), or to assemble multiple specific facts into the law of falling bodies ([[Galileo]] (1564–1642)).

==Themes==

===Compression===
&lt;!--Is this section common knowledge or original research? --&gt;
An abstraction can be seen as a [[data compression|compression]] process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin | url=http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165230/http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf | archivedate=2015-05-09 |title=The Limits Of Reason |journal=Scientific American |volume=294 |issue=3 |pages=74–81 |year=2006|pmid=16502614 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0306-74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mapping multiple different pieces of [[wikt:constituent|constituent]] data to a single piece of abstract data;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Gell-Mann]] (1995) &quot;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.6130010105/pdf What is complexity? Remarks on simplicity and complexity by the Nobel Prize-winning author of The Quark and the Jaguar]&quot; ''Complexity'' states the 'algorithmic information complexity' (AIC) of some string of bits is the shortest length computer program which can print out that string of bits.&lt;/ref&gt; based on similarities in the constituent data, for example, many different physical cats map to the abstraction &quot;CAT&quot;. This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between &quot;abstract&quot; and &quot;[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]&quot;. In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects, and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is [[#Physicality|itself an object]]).
:For example, ''[[#Simplification and ordering|picture 1 below]]''  illustrates the concrete relationship &quot;Cat sits on Mat&quot;.
Chains of abstractions can  be [[construe]]d,&lt;ref name = Ross&gt;Ross, L. (1987). The Problem of Construal in Social Inference and Social Psychology. In N. Grunberg, R.E. Nisbett, J. Singer (eds), ''A Distinctive Approach to psychological research: the influence of Stanley Schacter''. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; moving from neural impulses arising from sensory [[perception]] to basic abstractions such as color or [[shape]], to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat, to [[semantic]] abstractions such as the &quot;idea&quot; of a CAT, to classes of objects such as &quot;mammals&quot; and even categories such as &quot;[[#Physicality|object]]&quot; as opposed to &quot;action&quot;.
:For example, ''[[#Simplification and ordering|graph 1 below]]''  expresses the abstraction &quot;agent sits on location&quot;. This conceptual scheme entails no specific [[hierarchical]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] (such as the one mentioned involving cats and mammals), only a progressive [[#Simplification and ordering|exclusion of detail]].

===Instantiation===

Non-existent things in any particular place and time are often seen as abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times.

Those abstract things are then said to be ''multiply instantiated'', in the sense of ''picture 1'', ''picture 2'', etc., shown [[#Simplification and ordering|below]]. It is not sufficient, however, to define ''abstract'' ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define ''abstraction'' as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;telephone&quot; abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept &quot;cat&quot; or the concept &quot;telephone&quot;. Although the concepts &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;telephone&quot; are ''abstractions'', they are not ''abstract'' in the sense of the objects in ''graph 1''  [[#Simplification and ordering|below]]. We might look at other graphs, in a progression from ''cat'' to ''mammal'' to ''animal'', and see that ''animal'' is more abstract than ''mammal''; but on the other hand ''mammal'' is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to ''[[marsupial]]'' or ''[[monotreme]]''.

Perhaps confusingly, some [[philosophy|philosophies]] refer to ''[[trope (philosophy)|tropes]]'' (instances of properties) as ''[[abstract particular]]s''—e.g., the particular  [[red]]ness of a particular [[apple]] is an ''abstract particular''. This is similar to [[qualia]] and [[sumbebekos]].

===Material process===
Still retaining the primary meaning of 'abstrere' or 'to draw away from', the abstraction of money, for example, works by drawing away from the particular value of things allowing completely incommensurate objects to be compared (see the section on 'Physicality' below). [[Karl Marx]]'s writing on the [[commodity]] abstraction recognizes a parallel process.

The [[state (polity)]] as both concept and material practice exemplifies the two sides of this process of abstraction. Conceptually, 'the current concept of the state is an abstraction from the much more concrete early-modern use as the standing or status of the prince, his visible estates'. At the same time, materially, the 'practice of statehood is now constitutively and materially more abstract than at the time when princes ruled as the embodiment of extended power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In – Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}, pp. 318–19.&lt;/ref&gt; {{further|Power projection|Display behavior}}

===Ontological status===
The way that physical objects, like rocks and trees, have [[category of being|being]] differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being, for example the way the [[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], [[particular]], [[individual]]s pictured in ''[[#Simplification and ordering|picture 1]]'' exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in ''[[#Simplification and ordering|graph 1]]'' exist. That difference accounts for the [[ontological]] usefulness of the word &quot;abstract&quot;. The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.

===Physicality===
{{Further|History of accounting#Ancient history}}
A physical object (a possible referent of a concept or word) is considered ''concrete'' (not abstract) if it is a ''particular individual'' that occupies a particular place and time. However, in the secondary sense of the term 'abstraction', this physical object can carry materially abstracting processes. For example, record-keeping aids throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in containers. According to {{harvnb|Schmandt-Besserat|(1981)}}, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a [[bill of lading]] or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers for the count, marks were placed on the outside of the containers. These physical marks, in other words, acted as material abstractions of a materially abstract process of accounting, using conceptual abstractions (numbers) to communicate its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Eventually ([http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084757/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html |date=January 30, 2012 }}) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|author-link=Eleanor Robson|year=2008|title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq|isbn=978-0-691-09182-2}}. p. 5: these calculi were in use in Iraq for primitive accounting systems as early as 3200–3000 BCE, with commodity-specific counting representation systems. Balanced accounting was in use by 3000–2350 BCE, and a [[sexagesimal number system]] was in use 2350–2000 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in [[reality]] or exist only as sensory experiences, like the color [[red]]. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like ''God'', ''the number three'', and ''goodness'' are real, abstract, or both.

An approach to resolving such difficulty is to use ''[[predicate (grammar)|predicates]]'' as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g., ''good''). Questions about the properties of things are then [[proposition]]s about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the ''graph 1''  [[#Simplification and ordering|below]], the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates.

===Referencing and referring===
Abstractions sometimes have ambiguous [[referent]]s; for example, &quot;[[happiness]]&quot; (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or [[being|states of being]] which make them happy. Likewise, &quot;[[architecture]]&quot; refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of creation and [[innovation]] which aim at elegant solutions to [[construction]] problems, to the use of space, and to the attempt to evoke an [[emotion|emotional response]] in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.&lt;!--See discussion pages 3 to 12 in Eugene Raskin, ''Architecturally Speaking, 2nd edition'', a Delta book, Dell (1966), trade paperback, 129 pages--&gt;

===Simplification and ordering===
Abstraction uses a [[strategy]] of simplification, wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective [[communication]] about things in the abstract requires an [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient. This is true for all verbal/abstract communication.

[[File:Cat-on-mat.svg|thumb|250px|[[Conceptual graph]] for A Cat sitting on the Mat ''(graph 1)'']]
[[File:JerryFelix.JPG|right|thumb|125px|Cat on Mat ''(picture 1)'']]
For example, many different things can be [[red]]. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in ''picture 1'', to the right). The property of ''[[red]]ness'' and the [[Relation of Ideas|relation]] ''[[sitting|sitting-on]]'' are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram ''graph 1'' identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their five labels), whereas the ''picture 1'' shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.

''Graph 1'' details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example, the arrow between the ''agent'' and ''CAT:Elsie'' depicts an example of an ''[[is-a]]'' relationship, as does the arrow between the ''location'' and the ''MAT''. The arrows between the [[gerund]]/[[present participle]] ''SITTING'' and the [[noun]]s ''agent'' and ''location'' express the [[diagram]]'s basic relationship; ''&quot;agent is SITTING on location&quot;''; ''Elsie'' is an instance of ''CAT''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John F. Sowa|Sowa, John F.]] (1984). ''Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|978-0-201-14472-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the description ''sitting-on'' (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979):&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter]] (1979) ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:(1) a publication
::(2) a newspaper
:::(3) ''The San Francisco Chronicle''
::::(4) the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle''
:::::(5) my copy of the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle''
::::::(6) my copy of the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' as it was when I first picked it up (as contrasted with my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, burning)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no [[loss of generality]]. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about something, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.

===Thought processes===
In [[philosophy|philosophical terminology]], ''abstraction'' is the [[thinking|thought process]] wherein [[idea]]s&lt;ref&gt;But an idea can be [[symbol]]ized. &quot;A symbol is any device whereby we are enabled to make an abstraction.&quot; -- p.xi and chapter 20 of [[Suzanne K. Langer]] (1953), ''Feeling and Form: a theory of art developed from '''Philosophy in a New Key''''': New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 431 pages, index.&lt;/ref&gt; are distanced from [[object (philosophy)|objects]].

==As used in different disciplines==

===In art===
{{Main|Abstraction (art)}}
Typically, ''abstraction'' is used in the arts as a [[synonym]] for [[abstract art]] in general. Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003405/abstract-art|title=abstract art|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. NY/New Haven: The Drawing Center/Yale University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-10826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm National Gallery of Art: Abstraction.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608000000/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer science===
{{Main|Abstraction (software engineering)}}
[[Computer scientists]] use abstraction to make models that can be used and re-used without having to re-write all the program code for each new application on every different type of computer. They [[communication|communicate]] their solutions with the computer by writing [[source code]] in some particular [[computer language]] which can be translated into [[machine code]] for different types of computers to execute. Abstraction allows program designers to separate a framework (categorical concepts related to computing problems) from specific instances which implement details. This means that the program code can be written so that code doesn't have to depend on the specific details of supporting applications, [[operating system]] software, or hardware, but on a categorical concept of the solution. A solution to the problem   can then be integrated into the system framework with minimal additional work. This allows programmers to take advantage of another programmer's work, while requiring only an abstract understanding of the implementation of another's work, apart from the problem that it solves.

=== In general semantics ===
Abstractions and levels of abstraction play an important role in the theory of [[general semantics]] originated by [[Alfred Korzybski]]. [[Anatol Rapoport]] wrote: &quot;Abstracting is a mechanism by which an infinite variety of experiences can be mapped on short noises (words).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===In linguistics===
{{Main|Abstraction (linguistics)}}
Researchers in [[linguistics]] frequently apply abstraction so as to allow analysis of the phenomena of language at the desired level of detail. A commonly used abstraction, the ''[[phoneme]]'', abstracts [[speech sound]]s in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning. Other analogous kinds of abstractions (sometimes called &quot;[[emic unit]]s&quot;) considered by linguists include [[morpheme]]s, [[grapheme]]s, and [[lexeme]]s.

Abstraction also arises in the relation between [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]]. Pragmatics involves considerations that make reference to the user of the language; semantics considers expressions and what they denote (the [[designata]]) abstracted from the language user; and syntax considers only the expressions themselves, abstracted from the designata.

===In mathematics===
{{Main|Abstraction (mathematics)}}
Abstraction in [[mathematics]] is the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept or object&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#abstraction|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon — Abstraction|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.

The advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:
* It reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics.
* Known results in one area can suggest [[conjecture]]s in another related area.
* Techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in other related area.
*Patterns from one mathematical object can be generalized to other similar objects in the same class.

The main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and might require a degree of [[mathematical maturity]] and experience before they can be assimilated.

===In music===
In music, the term ''abstraction'' can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of [[tonality]]. [[Atonal]] music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM Washington State University: Glossary of Abstraction.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911121123/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM |date=September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In neurology===
{{Further|Intelligence|Mental rotation|Mental operations}}
A recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts. This is because abstract concepts elicit greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts which elicit greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Jing | last2 = Conder | first2 = Julie A. | last3 = Blitzer | first3 = David N. | last4 = Shinkareva | first4 = Svetlana V. | year = 2010 | title = Neural Representation of Abstract and Concrete Concepts: A Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Studies | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eab67598d4167534ba9566f4eaa552260da1c794| journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 31| issue = 10| pages = 1459–1468| doi = 10.1002/hbm.20950 | pmid = 20108224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research into the [[human brain]] suggests that the left and right hemispheres differ in their handling of abstraction. For example, one meta-analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Lewis &quot;Cortical Networks Related to Human Use of Tools&quot; '''12''' (3): 211–231 ''The Neuroscientist'' (June 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In philosophy===
Abstraction in [[philosophy]] is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in [[concept]] formation of recognizing some set of common features in [[individual]]s, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding [[empiricism]] and the [[problem of universals]]. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under [[predicate abstraction]]. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is thought space.

John Locke defined abstraction in [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]:

'So words are used to stand as outward marks of our internal ideas, which are taken from particular things; but if every particular idea that we take in had its own special name, there would be no end to names. To prevent this, the mind makes particular ideas received from particular things become general; which it does by considering them as they are in the mind—mental appearances—separate from all other existences, and from the circumstances of real existence, such as time, place, and so on. This procedure is called abstraction. In it, an idea taken from a particular thing becomes a general representative of all of the same kind, and its name becomes a general name that is applicable to any existing thing that fits that abstract idea.' 2.11.9

===In psychology===
[[Carl Jung]]'s definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive, different complementary psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies, such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is [[concretism (psychology)|concretism]]. ''Abstraction'' is one of Jung's 57 definitions in Chapter XI of ''[[Psychological Types]]''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is an abstract ''thinking'', just as there is abstract ''feeling'', ''sensation'' and ''intuition''. Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous ''sensation'' and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic ''intuition''. (Jung, [1921] (1971): par. 678).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In social theory===
In social theory, abstraction is used as both an ideational and material process. [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]], asked &quot;Can there be abstraction other than by thought?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He used the example of commodity abstraction to show that abstraction occurs in practice as people create systems of abstract exchange that extend beyond the immediate physicality of the object and yet have real and immediate consequences. This work was extended through the 'Constitutive Abstraction' approach of writers associated with the Journal [[Arena (Australian publishing co-operative)|''Arena'']]. Two books that have taken this theme of the abstraction of social relations as an organizing process in human history are {{Cite book |  title= Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community | url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0761950737}}(1996) and the second volume of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community, published in 2006: {{Cite book | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In – Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 }} These books argue that the nation is an abstract community bringing together strangers who will never meet as such; thus constituting materially real and substantial, but abstracted and mediated relations. The books suggest that contemporary processes of globalization and mediatization have contributed to materially abstracting relations between people, with major consequences for how we live our lives.

It can be easily argued that abstraction is an elementary methodological tool in several disciplines of social science. These disciplines have definite and different man concepts that highlight those aspects of man and his behaviour by idealization that are relevant for the given human science. For example, {{lang|la|homo sociologicus|italic=no}} is the man as sociology abstracts and idealizes it, depicting man as a social being. Moreover, we could talk about {{lang|la|homo cyber sapiens|italic=no}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steels |first=Luc |title=The Homo Cyber Sapiens, the Robot Homonidus Intelligens, and the 'Artificial Life' Approach to Artificial Intelligence |location=Brussel |publisher=Vrije Universiteit, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the man who can extend his biologically determined intelligence thanks to new technologies), or {{lang|la|homo creativus|italic=no}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Inkinen | first = Sam | year = 2009 | title = Homo Creativus – Creativity and Serendipity Management in Third Generation Science and Technology Parks | url = | journal = Science and Public Policy | volume = 36| issue = 7 | pages = 537–548| doi = 10.3152/030234209X465570}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who is simply creative).

Abstraction (combined with Weberian [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]]) plays a crucial role in [[economics]]. Breaking away from directly experienced reality was a common trend in 19th century sciences (especially [[physics]]), and this was the effort which was fundamentally determined the way economics tried and still tries to approach the economic aspects of social life. It is abstraction we meet in the case of both Newton's physics and the neoclassical theory, since the goal was to grasp the unchangeable and timeless essence of phenomena. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] created the concept of the material point by following the abstraction method so that he abstracted from the dimension and shape of any perceptible object, preserving only inertial and translational motion. Material point is the ultimate and common feature of all bodies. [[Neoclassical economists]] created the indefinitely abstract notion of [[homo economicus]] by following the same procedure. Economists abstract from all individual and personal qualities in order to get to those characteristics that embody the essence of economic activity. Eventually, it is the substance of the economic man that they try to grasp. Any characteristic beyond it only disturbs the functioning of this essential core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbács |first=Peter |chapter=Methodological Principles and an Epistemological Introduction|pages=1–52|title= The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics.

{{Group theory sidebar|Basics}}

In [[abstract algebra]], an '''abelian group''', also called a '''commutative group''', is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in which the result of applying the group [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written. That is, these are the groups that obey the axiom of [[commutativity]]. Abelian groups [[generalization|generalize]] the [[arithmetic]] of addition of [[integer]]s. They are named after early 19th century mathematician [[Niels Henrik Abel]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson 2009, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra, from which many other basic concepts, such as [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[vector space]]s, are developed. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their [[nonabelian group|non-abelian]] counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research.

{{Algebraic structures |Group}}

== Definition ==
{{Group-like structures}}
An abelian group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to form another element denoted &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt;. The symbol &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, &lt;math&gt;(A, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, must satisfy five requirements known as the ''abelian group axioms'':

;Closure: For all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the result of the operation &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; is also in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
;Associativity: For all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the equation &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b)\cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; holds.
;Identity element: There exists an element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, such that for all elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the equation &lt;math&gt;e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a&lt;/math&gt; holds.
;Inverse element: For each &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; there exists an element &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the identity element.
;Commutativity: For all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b = b \cdot a&lt;/math&gt;.

A group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a &quot;non-abelian group&quot; or &quot;non-commutative group&quot;.

== Facts ==

=== Notation ===
{{see also|Additive group|Multiplicative group}}
There are two main notational conventions for abelian groups – additive and multiplicative.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|-
! Convention
! Operation
! Identity
! Powers
! Inverse
|-
! Addition
| &lt;math&gt;x + y&lt;/math&gt; || 0 || &lt;math&gt;nx&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Multiplication
| &lt;math&gt;x \cdot y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; || 1
| &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Generally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for [[module (mathematics)|module]]s and [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered, some notable exceptions being [[near-ring]]s and [[partially ordered group]]s, where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian.

=== Multiplication table ===
To verify that a [[finite group]] is abelian, a table (matrix) – known as a [[Cayley table]] – can be constructed in a similar fashion to a [[multiplication table]]. If the group is &lt;math&gt;G = \{g_1 = e, g_2, \dots, g_n \}&lt;/math&gt; under the operation &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;(i, j)&lt;/math&gt;-th entry of this table contains the product &lt;math&gt;g_i \cdot g_j&lt;/math&gt;. The group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal.

This is true since if the group is abelian, then &lt;math&gt;g_i \cdot g_j = g_j \cdot g_i&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that the &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; entry of the table equals the &lt;math&gt;(j,i)&lt;/math&gt; entry, thus the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.

== Examples ==
* For the [[integer]]s and the operation [[addition]] &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}, +)&lt;/math&gt;, the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the [[additive identity]], every integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has an [[additive inverse]], &lt;math&gt;-n&lt;/math&gt;, and the addition operation is commutative since &lt;math&gt;n + m = m + n&lt;/math&gt; for any two integers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
* Every [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is abelian, because if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;xy = a^ma^n = a^{m+n} = a^na^m = yx&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the [[integer]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, form an abelian group under addition, as do the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Every [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a [[commutative ring]] the invertible elements, or [[unit (ring theory)|units]], form an abelian [[multiplicative group]]. In particular, the [[real number]]s are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication.
* Every [[subgroup]] of an abelian group is [[normal subgroup|normal]], so each subgroup gives rise to a [[quotient group]]. Subgroups, quotients, and [[Direct sum of groups|direct sums]] of abelian groups are again abelian. The finite [[simple group|simple]] abelian groups are exactly the cyclic groups of prime order.&lt;ref&gt;Rose 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYk6AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The concepts of abelian group and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] agree.  More specifically, every &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-module is an abelian group with its operation of addition, and every abelian group is a module over the ring of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; in a unique way.

In general, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication – one example is the group of &lt;math&gt;2 \times 2&lt;/math&gt; [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].

== Historical remarks ==
&lt;!-- This particular statement seems to be suspect, but the direction is right. Note: updated and corrected on Sept. 2, 2012 --&gt;
[[Camille Jordan]] named abelian groups after [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]], because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of a [[polynomial]] implies that the roots of the polynomial can be [[solvability by radicals|calculated by using radicals]]. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background.

== Properties ==
If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[natural number]] and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an element of an abelian group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; written additively, then &lt;math&gt;nx&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;x + x + \cdots + x&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; summands) and &lt;math&gt;(-n)x = -(nx)&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; becomes a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of integers. In fact, the modules over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with the abelian groups.

Theorems about abelian groups (i.e. [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over the [[principal ideal domain]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s which is a specialization of the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;f, g: G \to H&lt;/math&gt; are two [[group homomorphism]]s between abelian groups, then their sum &lt;math&gt;f + g&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a non-abelian group.) The set &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(G,H)&lt;/math&gt; of all group homomorphisms from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.

Somewhat akin to the [[dimension]] of [[vector space]]s, every abelian group has a ''[[rank of an abelian group|rank]]''. It is defined as the maximal [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of a set of [[linearly independent]] elements of the group. The integers and the [[rational number]]s have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals.

The [[center (group theory)|center]] &lt;math&gt;Z(G)&lt;/math&gt; of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the set of elements that commute with every element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. A group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is abelian if and only if it is equal to its center &lt;math&gt;Z(G)&lt;/math&gt;. The center of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is always a [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] abelian subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. If the quotient group &lt;math&gt;G/Z(G)&lt;/math&gt; of a group by its center is cyclic then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is abelian.&lt;ref&gt;Rose 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYk6AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finite abelian groups ==
Cyclic groups of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The [[automorphism group]] of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of [[Georg Frobenius]] and [[Ludwig Stickelberger]] and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of [[linear algebra]].

Any group of prime order is isomorphic to a cyclic group and therefore abelian. Any group whose order is a square of a prime number is also abelian.&lt;ref&gt;Rose 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYk6AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA79 p. 79].&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, for every prime number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; there are (up to isomorphism) exactly two groups of order &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt;, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p\times\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Classification ===
The '''fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups''' states that every finite abelian group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of [[prime number|prime]]-power order; it is also known as the '''basis theorem for finite abelian groups'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Hans Kurzweil|Kurzweil, H.]], &amp; [[:de:Bernd Stellmacher|Stellmacher, B.]], ''The Theory of Finite Groups: An Introduction'' (New York, Berlin, Heidelberg: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Verlag]], 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iebSBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA43 pp. 43–54].&lt;/ref&gt; This is generalized by the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]], with finite groups being the special case when ''G'' has zero [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.

The classification was proven by [[Leopold Kronecker]] in 1870, though it was not stated in modern group-theoretic terms until later, and was preceded by a similar classification of quadratic forms by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1801; see [[Fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups#History|history]] for details.

The cyclic group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;mn&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the direct sum of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are [[coprime]]. It follows that any finite abelian group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_{i=1}^{u}\ \mathbf{Z}_{k_i}&lt;/math&gt;

in either of the following canonical ways:
* the numbers &lt;math&gt;k_1, k_2, \dots, k_u&lt;/math&gt; are powers of (not necessarily distinct) primes,
* or &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; [[divisor|divides]] &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;, which divides &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt;, and so on up to &lt;math&gt;k_u&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{15}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{15} \cong  \{0,5,10\} \oplus \{0,3,6,9,12\}&lt;/math&gt;. The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].

For another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_8&lt;/math&gt; (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_4\oplus \mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus \mathbb{Z}_2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

See also [[list of small groups]] for finite abelian groups of order 30 or less.

=== Automorphisms ===
One can apply the [[#Classification|fundamental theorem]] to count (and sometimes determine) the [[Group isomorphism#Automorphisms|automorphisms]] of a given finite abelian group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, one uses the fact that if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; splits as a direct sum &lt;math&gt;H\oplus K&lt;/math&gt; of subgroups of [[coprime]] order, then &lt;math&gt;\text{Aut}(H\oplus K) \cong \text{Aut}(H)\oplus \text{Aut}(K)&lt;/math&gt;.

Given this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the [[Sylow theorems|Sylow]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;). Fix a prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and suppose the exponents &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; of the cyclic factors of the Sylow &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:

:&lt;math&gt;e_1\leq e_2 \leq\cdots\leq e_n&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. One needs to find the automorphisms of

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_1}} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbf{Z}_{p^{e_n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

One special case is when &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-subgroup &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite [[cyclic group]] can be used. Another special case is when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary but &lt;math&gt;e_i = 1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; 1 \le i  \le n&lt;/math&gt;. Here, one is considering &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to be of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_p \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbf{Z}_p,&lt;/math&gt;

so elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; over the finite field of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; elements &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(P)\cong\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbf{F}_p),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}&lt;/math&gt; is the appropriate [[general linear group]]. This is easily shown to have order

:&lt;math&gt; \left|\operatorname{Aut}(P)\right|=(p^n-1)\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

In the most general case, where the &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines

:&lt;math&gt;d_k=\max\{r\mid e_r = e_k^{\,}\}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;c_k=\min\{r\mid e_r=e_k\}&lt;/math&gt;

then one has in particular &lt;math&gt;k \le d_k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_k \le k&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt; \left|\operatorname{Aut}(P)\right| = \prod_{k=1}^n (p^{d_k}-p^{k-1}) \prod_{j=1}^n (p^{e_j})^{n-d_j} \prod_{i=1}^n (p^{e_i-1})^{n-c_i+1}. &lt;/math&gt;

One can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see Hillar, C., &amp; Rhea, D.).

==Finitely generated abelian groups==
{{main|Finitely generated abelian group}}
An abelian group {{mvar|A}} is finitely generated if it contains a finite set of elements (called ''generators'') &lt;math&gt;G=\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; such that every element of the group is a [[linear combination]] with integer coefficients of elements of {{mvar|G}}. 

Let {{mvar|L}} be a [[free abelian group]] with basis &lt;math&gt;B=\{b_1, \ldots, b_n\}.&lt;/math&gt; 
There is a unique [[group homomorphism]]
&lt;math&gt;p\colon L \to A,&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt;p(b_i) = x_i\quad \text{for } i=1,\ldots, n.&lt;/math&gt;
This homomorphism is surjective, and its [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] is finitely generated (since integers form a [[Noetherian ring]]). Consider the matrix {{mvar|M}} with integer entries, such that the entries of its {{mvar|j}}th column are the coefficients of the {{mvar|j}}th generator of the kernel. Then, the abelian group is isomorphic to the [[cokernel]] of linear map defined by {{mvar|M}}. Conversely every [[integer matrix]] defines a finitely generated abelian group.

It follows that the study of finitely generated abelian groups is totally equivalent with the study of integer matrices. In particular, changing the generating set of {{mvar|A}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the left by a [[unimodular matrix]] (that is, an invertible integer matrix whose inverse is also an integer matrix). Changing the generating set of the kernel of {{mvar|M}} is equivalent with multiplying {{mvar|M}} on the right by an unimodular matrix.

The [[Smith normal form]] of {{mvar|M}} is a matrix
:&lt;math&gt;S=UMV,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|U}} and {{mvar|V}} are unimodular, and {{mvar|S}} is a matrix such that all non-diagonal entries are zero, the non-zero diagonal entries {{tmath|d_{1,1}, \ldots, d_{k,k} }} are the first ones, and {{tmath|d_{j,j} }} is a divisor of {{tmath|d_{i,i} }} for {{math|''i'' &gt; ''j''}}. The existence and the shape of the Smith normal proves that the finitely generated abelian group {{mvar|A}} is the [[direct sum]] 
:&lt;math&gt;\Z^r \oplus \Z/d_{1,1}\Z \oplus \cdots \oplus \Z/d_{k,k}\Z,&lt;/math&gt; 
where {{mvar|r}} is the number of zero rows at the bottom of {{mvar|r}} (and also the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of the group). This is the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]].

The existence of algorithms for Smith normal form shows that the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups is not only a theorem of abstract existence, but provides a way for computing expression of finitely generated abelian groups as direct sums.

== Infinite abelian groups ==
The simplest infinite abelian group is the [[infinite cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Any [[finitely generated abelian group]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the direct sum of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; copies of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many [[cyclic group]]s of [[prime power]] orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, called the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.

By contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. [[Divisible group]]s, i.e. abelian groups &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in which the equation &lt;math&gt;nx = a&lt;/math&gt; admits a solution &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; for any natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and [[Prüfer group]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p/Z_p&lt;/math&gt; for various prime numbers &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined.&lt;ref&gt;For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} \cong \sum_p \mathbb{Q}_p/\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if a divisible group &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of an abelian group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; admits a direct complement: a subgroup &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G = A \oplus C&lt;/math&gt;. Thus divisible groups are [[injective module]]s in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible ([[Baer's criterion]]). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called '''reduced'''.

Two important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are ''torsion groups'' and ''torsion-free groups'', exemplified by the groups &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (periodic) and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; (torsion-free).

=== Torsion groups ===

An abelian group is called '''[[periodic group|periodic]]''' or '''[[torsion (algebra)|torsion]]''', if every element has finite [[order (group theory)|order]]. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second [[Prüfer theorems]] state that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a periodic group, and it either has a '''bounded exponent''', i.e., &lt;math&gt;nA = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, or is countable and the [[height (abelian group)|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-heights]] of the elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are finite for each &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Countability assumption in the second Prüfer theorem cannot be removed: the torsion subgroup of the [[direct product]] of the cyclic groups &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/p^m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; for all natural &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is not a direct sum of cyclic groups.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/p^m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; in such a decomposition is an invariant of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. These theorems were later subsumed in the '''Kulikov criterion'''. In a different direction, [[Helmut Ulm]] found an extension of the second Prüfer theorem to countable abelian &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their [[Ulm invariant]]s.

=== Torsion-free and mixed groups ===

An abelian group is called '''torsion-free''' if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of [[torsion-free abelian group]]s have been studied extensively:

* [[Free abelian group]]s, i.e. arbitrary direct sums of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Cotorsion group|Cotorsion]] and [[algebraically compact module|algebraically compact]] torsion-free groups such as the [[p-adic integer|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic integers]]
* [[Slender group]]s

An abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called '''mixed'''. If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group and &lt;math&gt;T(A)&lt;/math&gt; is its [[torsion subgroup]], then the factor group  &lt;math&gt;A/T(A)&lt;/math&gt; is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, so  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;T(A) \oplus A/T(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups. The additive group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of integers is torsion-free &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-module.&lt;ref&gt;Lal, R., ''Algebra 2: Linear Algebra, Galois Theory, Representation Theory, Group Extensions and Schur Multiplier'' (Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer, 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwPNDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206 p. 206].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|206}}

=== Invariants and classification ===
One of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is its [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]: the cardinality of the maximal [[linearly independent]] subset of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1]] are necessarily subgroups of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_r&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, the group of [[p-adic integer|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic integers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt; is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-rank and the groups &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p^n&lt;/math&gt; with different &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.

The classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are [[pure subgroup|pure]] and [[basic subgroup|basic]] subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by [[Irving Kaplansky]], [[László Fuchs]], [[Phillip Griffith]], and [[David Arnold (mathematician)|David Arnold]], as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in ''[[Lecture Notes in Mathematics]]'' for more recent findings.

=== Additive groups of rings ===
The additive group of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:

* [[Tensor product]]
* Corner's results on countable torsion-free groups
* Shelah's work to remove cardinality restrictions.

== Relation to other mathematical topics ==
Many large abelian groups possess a natural [[topology]], which turns them into [[topological group]]s.

The collection of all abelian groups, together with the [[Group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] between them, forms the [[category of abelian groups|category]] &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Ab}&lt;/math&gt;, the prototype of an [[abelian category]].

Nearly all well-known [[algebraic structure]]s other than [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]]. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student {{harvs|first=Wanda|last=Szmielew|authorlink=Wanda Szmielew|year=1955|txt}} proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:
*Amongst torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank, only the finitely generated case and the [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1|rank 1]] case are well understood;
*There are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups;
*While countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the case of countable mixed groups is much less mature.
*Many mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable.
*Finite abelian groups remain a topic of research in [[computational group theory]].

Moreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the [[set theory]] commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the [[Whitehead problem]]: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also [[free abelian group]]s? In the 1970s, [[Saharon Shelah]] proved that the Whitehead problem is:
* [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|Undecidable in ZFC]] ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]]), the conventional [[axiomatic set theory]] from which nearly all of present-day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC;
* Undecidable even if [[ZFC]] is augmented by taking the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] as an axiom;
* Positively answered if ZFC is augmented with the axiom of [[Constructible universe|constructibility]] (see [[statements true in L]]).

== A note on the typography ==
Among mathematical [[adjective]]s derived from the [[proper name]] of a [[mathematician]], the word &quot;abelian&quot; is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase '''a''', rather than an uppercase '''A''', indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701231658/http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html |archive-date=1 July 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=3 July 2016|title=Abel Prize Awarded: The Mathematicians' Nobel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty''' ('''ABM Treaty''' or '''ABMT''') (1972—2002) was an [[arms control]] [[treaty]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] on the limitation of the [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) systems used in defending areas against [[ballistic missile]]-delivered [[nuclear weapon]]s.  Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Signed in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/trty/16332.htm |title=Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems |date=26 May 1972 |website=Bureau of Arms Control |publisher=United States Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, four former Soviet republics agreed with the United States to succeed the USSR's role in the treaty.  In June 2002 the United States withdrew from the treaty, leading to its termination.

==Background==
[[File:Icbm-hist-en.png|thumb|left|165px|upright=1.2|Deployment history of land based ICBM 1959–2014]]
Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming [[ICBM]] warheads.  During this period, the US considered the defense of the US as part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange. As part of this defense, [[Canada]] and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called [[NORAD|North American Aerospace Defense Command]]).

By the early 1950s, US research on the [[Project Nike|Nike Zeus]] missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of an operational ABM system. Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves. By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed [[National Missile Defense#Sentinel Program|Sentinel]]. In 1967, the US announced that Sentinel itself would be scaled down to the smaller and less expensive [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard]]. Soviet doctrine called for development of its own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US. This was achieved with the operational deployment of the [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system|A-35 ABM system]] and its successors, which remain operational to this day.

The development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle ([[MIRV]]) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time.  An ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer number of warheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==ABM Treaty==
[[File:Carter_Brezhnev_sign_SALT_II.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] signing SALT II treaty, 18 June 1979, in Vienna.]]
The United States first proposed an anti-ballistic missile treaty at the 1967 [[Glassboro Summit Conference]] during discussions between U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union [[Alexei Kosygin]].  McNamara argued both that ballistic missile defense could provoke an arms race, and that it might provoke a first-strike against the nation fielding the defense. Kosygin rejected this reasoning. They were trying to minimize the number of nuclear missiles in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the [[SALT I|Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] began in November 1969 (SALT I). By 1972 an agreement had been reached to limit strategic defensive systems. Each country was allowed two sites at which it could base a defensive system, one for the capital and one for ICBM silos.

The treaty was signed during the [[Moscow Summit (1972)|1972 Moscow Summit]] on 26 May by the [[President of the United States]], [[Richard Nixon]] and the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; and ratified by the US Senate on 3 August 1972.

The 1974 Protocol reduced the number of sites to one per party, largely because neither country had developed a second site.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS reference&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/|title=ABM treaty reduces US and USSR to one ABM site each|work=The Nuclear Information Project|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists|FAS]]|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sites were [[Moscow]] for the USSR and the North Dakota [[Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex|Safeguard Complex]] for the US, which was already under construction.

===Missiles limited by the treaty===
The Treaty limited only ABMs capable of defending against &quot;strategic ballistic missiles&quot;, without attempting to define &quot;strategic&quot;. It was understood that both ICBMs and [[SLBM]]s are obviously &quot;strategic&quot;.&lt;ref name=Daalder&gt;{{cite journal|title=A tactical defence initiative for the Western Europe?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=May 1987|volume=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgYAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=8 February 2011|author=Ivo H. Daalder|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither country intended to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs. The topic became disputable as soon as most potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs (SLBMs naturally tend to be much slower than ICBMs), nevertheless both sides continued counter-tactical ABM development.&lt;ref name=Daalder /&gt;

==After the SDI announcement==
[[File:C13571-8a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|President Reagan delivering the 23 March 1983 speech initiating SDI]]
On 23 March 1983, [[Ronald Reagan]] announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], a research program into ballistic missile defense which would be &quot;consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty&quot;. Reagan was wary of mutual deterrence with what he had recently called an &quot;[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]&quot;, and wanted to escape the traditional confines of [[mutual assured destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garthoff|first1=Raymond L.|title=The Great Transition: American-Soviet Relations and the End of the Cold War|url=https://archive.org/details/greattransitiona00gart|url-access=registration|date=1994|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8157-3060-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/greattransitiona00gart/page/99 99]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was a blow to [[Yuri Andropov]]'s so-called &quot;peace offensive&quot;. Andropov said that &quot;It is time [Washington] stopped thinking up one option after another in search of the best way of unleashing nuclear war in the hope of winning it. To do this is not just irresponsible. It is madness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Pravda]]|date=27 March 1983|title=Replies by Yu. V. Andropov to Questions from a Correspondent of Pravda}} Cited in {{cite book|last1=Garthoff|first1=Raymond L.|title=The Great Transition: American-Soviet Relations and the End of the Cold War|url=https://archive.org/details/greattransitiona00gart|url-access=registration|date=1994|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8157-3060-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/greattransitiona00gart/page/111 111]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the opposition, Reagan gave every indication that SDI would not be used as a bargaining chip and that the United States would do all in its power to build the system. The Soviets were threatened because the Americans might have been able to make a nuclear first strike possible. In ''The Nuclear Predicament,'' Beckman claims that one of the central goals of Soviet diplomacy was to terminate SDI. A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a &quot;ragged&quot; Soviet retaliatory response. Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy.  The Soviets could not afford to ignore Reagan's new endeavor, therefore their policy at the time was to enter negotiations with the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Beckman ''et al.'', The Nuclear Predicament: Nuclear Weapons In The Cold War And Beyond, 2nd ed. (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc, 1992), 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Wayne Howell, &quot;[http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/rpa/pdf/2_RP_11-3_Howell_389-415.pdf Reagan and Reykjavík: Arms Control, SDI, and the Argument From Human Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180126/http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/rpa/pdf/2_RP_11-3_Howell_389-415.pdf |date=3 October 2011 }},&quot; ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs, Vol. 11'', No. 3, 2008, pp. 389–415&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1987, however, the USSR withdrew its opposition, concluding the SDI posed no threat and scientifically &quot;would never work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Norman A. Graebner, Richard Dean Burns, and Joseph M. Siracusa, ''Reagan, Bush, Gorbachev: Revisiting the End of the Cold War,'' p. 95, 2008.  {{ISBN|0313352410}}, {{ISBN|978-0313352416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Julian E.

SDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped-for result. SDI research was cut back following the end of Reagan's presidency, and in 1995 it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that &quot;missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability.&quot;  This was reaffirmed in 1997.

==Successor states to Soviet Union agree to continue treaty in force==
[[File:Bush and Putin signing SORT.jpg|thumb|236px|upright=1.3|Presidents [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[George W. Bush]] sign SORT on 24 May 2002 in Moscow]]
Although the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991, in the view of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], the treaty continued in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=Although the ABM Treaty continues in force, it nevertheless has become necessary to reach agreement as to which New Independent States (NIS) would collectively assume the rights and obligations of the USSR under the Treaty.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional memorandum of understanding was prepared in 1997, establishing Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine as successor states to the Soviet Union, for the purposes of the treaty.

==United States withdrawal==
On 13 December 2001, [[George W. Bush]] gave [[Russia]] notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that required six months' notice before terminating the pact—the first time in recent history that the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Withdrawal From the ABM Treaty: President Bush's Remarks and U.S. Diplomatic Notes|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2002_01-02/docjanfeb02|publisher=Arms Control Association|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the eventual creation of the American [[Missile Defense Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/12/20011213-2.html &quot;Announcement of Withdrawal from the ABM Treaty&quot;, White House press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited [[National Missile Defense]] to protect the United States from [[nuclear blackmail]] by a [[rogue state]]. The withdrawal also had many critics. John Rhinelander, a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a &quot;fatal blow&quot; to the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and would lead to a &quot;world without effective legal constraints on [[nuclear proliferation]].&quot; The construction of a missile defense system was also feared to enable the US to attack with a nuclear [[first strike]]. Former [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Perry]] also criticized the U.S. withdrawal as a very bad decision.&lt;ref&gt;New York Review of Books, 14 Jul. 2016, [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/07/14/a-stark-nuclear-warning/ &quot;A Stark Nuclear Warning&quot;] &lt;/ref&gt;

Putin responded to the withdrawal by ordering a build-up of [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|Russia's nuclear capabilities]], designed to counterbalance U.S. capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Majumdar | first=Dave | date=1 March 2018 | title=Russia's Nuclear Weapons Buildup Is Aimed at Beating U.S. Missile Defenses | url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/russias-nuclear-weapons-buildup-aimed-beating-us-missile-24716 | work=The National Interest | location=USA | access-date=26 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia and the United States signed the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] in Moscow on 24 May 2002. This treaty mandates cuts in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but without actually mandating cuts to total stockpiled warheads, and without any mechanism for enforcement.

In [[The Putin Interviews|interviews]] with [[Oliver Stone]] in 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that in trying to persuade Russia to accept US withdrawal from the treaty, both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]] had tried, without evidence, to convince him of an emerging nuclear threat from [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Oliver |title=The Putin Interviews (Party 2 - 2:10) |url=https://www.sho.com/the-putin-interviews |website=www.sho.com |publisher=Showtime |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2018 statement by Putin on new weapons==
On 1 March 2018, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], in an [[Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly (Russia)|address]] to the Federal Assembly, announced the development of a series of technologically new missile systems and stressed that those were designed as a response to U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly|url=http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/56957|website=kremlin.ru|language=en|date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/exclusive-putin-denies-cold-war-1174558275948 Exclusive: Putin blames U.S. for arms race, denies 'new Cold War'] NBC News, 1 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Beyond Russia's Development of New weapons: Insights From Military Innovation and Emulation Theory|url=https://www.academia.edu/37010220|journal=Boletim de Conjuntura Nerint|language=en|date=20 July 2018|last1=Dall|first1=Augusto César}}&lt;/ref&gt; His statements were referred to by the Trump administration officials as largely boastful untruths, but also as confirmation that &quot;Russia has been developing destabilizing weapons systems for over a decade, in direct violation of its treaty obligations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/01/europe/putin-russia-missile-intl/ Putin claims new 'invincible' missile can pierce US defenses] CNN, 1 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed with the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], and was dissolved following the [[World War I|First World War]].

The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. It consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]] in 1868. It was ruled by the [[House of Habsburg]], and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power. Foreign and military affairs came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states.

Austria-Hungary was a [[multinational state]] and one of Europe's major powers at the time. Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in [[Europe]] after the [[Russian Empire]], at {{convert|621538|km2|sqmi|sp=us|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=ah1911/&gt; and the third-most populous (after Russia and the [[German Empire]]).

Austria-Hungary was one of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], which began with an Austro-Hungarian war declaration on the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] on 28 July 1914. It was already effectively dissolved by the time the military authorities signed the [[armistice of Villa Giusti]] on 3 November 1918. The [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[First Austrian Republic]] were treated as its [[succession of states|successors ''de jure'']], whereas the independence of the [[West Slavs]] and [[South Slavs]] of the Empire as the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]], the [[Second Polish Republic]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], respectively, and most of the territorial demands of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] were also recognized by the victorious powers in 1920.

==Structure and name==
The realm's official name was in '''{{lang-de|Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie}}''' and in '''{{lang-hu|Osztrák–Magyar Monarchia}}''' ({{lang-en|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy}}),&lt;ref&gt;Manuscript of Franz Joseph I. – Stephan Vajda, Felix Austria.

The realm's full name used in the internal administration was '''The Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] and the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen]]'''.

[[German language|German]]: {{lang|de|Die im Reichsrat vertretenen Königreiche und Länder und die Länder der Heiligen Ungarischen Stephanskrone}}

Certain regions, such as [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Polish Galicia]] within Cisleithania and [[Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia|Croatia]] within Transleithania, enjoyed autonomous status, each with its own unique governmental structures (see: [[Austrian Poland#Galician autonomy|Polish Autonomy in Galicia]] and [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]]).

The division between Austria and Hungary was so marked that there was no common citizenship: one was either an Austrian citizen or a Hungarian citizen, never both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EvCfTIsTOskC&amp;pg=PA401|title=Austria-Hungary and the Successor States: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present|first=Eric|last=Roman|page=401|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9780816074693|access-date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q48xAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=austria-hungary+%22common+citizenship%22|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2003|isbn=9780852299616|access-date=1 January 2013|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also meant that there were always separate Austrian and Hungarian passports, never a common one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00600/00691/00036/15.html|first=Ferenc Tibor|last=Szávai|title=Könyvszemle (Book review): Kozári Monika: ''A dualista rendszer (1867–1918)'': Modern magyar politikai rendszerek|work=Magyar Tudomány|issue=2006/12|page=1542|language=Hungarian|access-date=20 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728084544/http://epa.oszk.hu/00600/00691/00036/15.html|archive-date=28 July 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://tortenelemszak.elte.hu/data/25756/SzavaiFeri.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cj8Um8U2?url=http://tortenelemszak.elte.hu/data/25756/SzavaiFeri.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 December 2012|first=Ferenc|last=Szávai|title=Osztrák–magyar külügyi ingatlanok hovatartozása a Monarchia felbomlása után|language=Hungarian|page=598|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither Austrian nor Hungarian passports were used in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]].

The Kingdom of Hungary had always maintained a separate parliament, the [[Diet of Hungary]], even after the Austrian Empire was created in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In 1804 Emperor Franz assumed the title of Emperor of Austria for all the ''[[Erblande]]'' of the dynasty and for the other lands, including Hungary. Thus Hungary formally became part of the Empire of Austria. The Court reassured the diet, however, that the assumption of the monarch's new title did not in any sense affect the laws and the constitution of Hungary.&quot; {{Citation|last=Laszlo|first=Péter|title=Hungary's Long Nineteenth Century: Constitutional and Democratic Traditions|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, the Netherlands|year=2011|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration and government of the Kingdom of Hungary (until 1848–49 Hungarian revolution) remained largely untouched by the government structure of the overarching Austrian Empire. Hungary's central government structures remained well separated from the Austrian imperial government. The country was governed by the Council of Lieutenancy of Hungary (the Gubernium) – located in [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] and later in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] – and by the Hungarian Royal Court Chancellery in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Éva H.

Despite Austria and Hungary sharing a common currency, they were fiscally sovereign and independent entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=European Review of Economic History|date=April 2006|volume=10|issue=1|first=Marc|last=Flandreau|asin=B00440PZZC|id=1361–4916|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=431004|pages=3–33|access-date=18 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115004305/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=431004|archive-date=15 November 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginnings of the personal union (from 1527), the government of the Kingdom of Hungary could preserve its separate and independent budget.

The agreements were renewed and signed by Vienna and Budapest at the end of every decade because both countries hoped to derive mutual economic benefit from the customs union.

Austria-Hungary was a [[great power]] but it contained a large number of ethnic groups that sought their own nation. The Dual Monarchy was effectively ruled by a coalition of the two most powerful and numerous ethnic groups, the Germans and the Hungarians. Stresses regarding nationalism were building up, and the severe shock of a poorly handled war caused the system to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oJ7HpQu4GgC&amp;pg=PA201|title=Disaster Ending in Final Victory: The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire|first=Gaetano|last=Cavallaro|publisher=Gaetano Cavallaro|year=2010|page=201|isbn=9781413468014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AwxMAaCXTfwC&amp;pg=PA130|title=Researching World War I: A Handbook|first1=Robin D.

Vienna served as the Monarchy's primary capital. The Cisleithanian (Austrian) part contained about 57 percent of the total population and the larger share of its economic resources, compared to the Hungarian part.

The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (called the ''Ausgleich'' in German and the ''Kiegyezés'' in Hungarian), which inaugurated the empire's dual structure in place of the former [[Austrian Empire]] (1804–1867), originated at a time when Austria had declined in strength and in power—both in the [[Italian Peninsula]] (as a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] of 1859) and among the states of the [[German Confederation]] (it had been surpassed by [[Prussia]] as the dominant German-speaking power following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866).&lt;ref&gt;Kann (1974); Sked (1989); Taylor (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The Compromise re-established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=André Gerrits|author2=Dirk Jan Wolffram|title=Political Democracy and Ethnic Diversity in Modern European History|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2005|page=42|isbn=9780804749763|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFY_iWZAj7kC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Ausgleich+%22hungarian+parliament%22+re-established#v=onepage&amp;q=Ausgleich%20%22hungarian%20parliament%22%20re-established}}&lt;/ref&gt; the full sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hungary, which was lost after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].

Other factors in the constitutional changes were continued Hungarian dissatisfaction with rule from Vienna and increasing national consciousness on the part of other nationalities (or ethnicities) of the Austrian Empire. Hungarian dissatisfaction arose partly from Austria's suppression with [[Russian Empire|Russian]] support of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Hungarian liberal revolution]] of 1848–49. However, dissatisfaction with Austrian rule had grown for many years within Hungary and had many other causes.

By the late 1850s, a large number of Hungarians who had supported the 1848–49 revolution were willing to accept the Habsburg monarchy. They argued that while Hungary had the right to full internal independence, under the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], foreign affairs and defense were &quot;common&quot; to both Austria and Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1974&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kann|1974|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Battle of Königgrätz|Austrian defeat at Königgrätz]], the government realized it needed to reconcile with Hungary to regain the status of a great power. The new foreign minister, [[Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust]], wanted to conclude the stalemated negotiations with the Hungarians. To secure the monarchy, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] began negotiations for a compromise with the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nobility, led by [[Ferenc Deák]], to ensure their support. In particular, Hungarian leaders demanded and received the Emperor's coronation as King of Hungary and the re-establishment of a separate parliament at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] with powers to enact laws for the lands of the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1974&quot;/&gt;

From 1867 onwards, the abbreviations heading the names of official institutions in Austria-Hungary reflected their responsibility: {{lang|de|k. u. k.}} (''{{lang|de|kaiserlich und königlich}}'' or [[Imperial and Royal]]) was the label for institutions common to both parts of the Monarchy, e.g. the ''{{lang|de|k.u.k. Kriegsmarine}}'' (War Fleet) and, during the war, the ''{{lang|de|k.u.k. Armee}}'' (Army). There were three ''{{lang|de|k.u.k.}}'' or joint ministries:
* The Imperial and Royal Ministry of the Exterior and the Imperial House
* The Imperial and Royal War Ministry
* The Imperial and Royal Ministry of Finance

The last was responsible only for financing the Imperial and Royal household, the diplomatic service, the common army and the common war fleet. All other state functions were to be handled separately by each of the two states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1964&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1964|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1867 onwards, common expenditures were allocated 70% to Austria and 30% to Hungary. This split had to be negotiated every decade. By 1907, the Hungarian share had risen to 36.4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;kronenbitter&quot;/&gt; The negotiations in 1917 ended with the dissolution of the Dual Monarchy.

The common army changed its label from ''{{lang|de|k.k.}}'' to ''{{lang|de|k.u.k.}}'' only in 1889 at the request of the Hungarian government.
* ''{{lang|de|K. k.}}'' (''{{lang|de|kaiserlich-königlich}}'') or [[Imperial-Royal]] was the term for institutions of [[Cisleithania]] (Austria); &quot;royal&quot; in this label referred to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]].
* ''{{lang|de|K. u.}}'' (''{{lang|de|königlich-ungarisch}}'') or ''{{lang|de|M. k.}}'' (''{{lang|de|Magyar királyi}}'') (&quot;Royal Hungarian&quot;) referred to [[Transleithania]], the lands of the Hungarian crown. In the [[Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia]], its autonomous institutions hold ''k.'' (''{{lang|de|kraljevski}}'') (&quot;Royal&quot;) as according to the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]] the only official language in Croatia and Slavonia was [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and those institutions were &quot;only&quot; Croatian.

[[File:Parlament Wien abends edit.jpg|thumb|Austrian Parliament building]]
[[File:Parliament Buildung Hungary 20090920.jpg|thumb|Hungarian Parliament building]]

Hungary and Austria maintained separate [[parliament]]s each with its own [[prime minister]]. Linking/co-ordinating the two parliaments fell to a government under the monarch. In this sense Austria-Hungary remained under an autocratic government, as the Emperor-King appointed both Austrian and Hungarian Prime ministers along with their respective cabinets. This made both Governments responsible to the Emperor-King, as neither half could have a government with a program contrary to the views of the Monarch. The Emperor-King could appoint non-parliamentary governments, for example, or maintain in power a government which did not have a majority in Parliament to block the formation of another of which he did not approve. The Monarch had other prerogatives such as the right of Royal Assent before any kind of Bill would be presented to the National Assembly (the common name for the Hungarian Diet), the right to veto all legislation passed by the National Assembly, and the power to prorogue or dissolve the Assembly and call for new elections (he had the same prerogatives considering the Croatian-Slavonian Diet or Croatian Parliament, the common name for the Croatian-Slavonian Diet). In the Austrian half, however, the Monarchs's power was even greater, as the Emperor had the power to both appoint and dismiss its Prime minister and cabinet members. The monarch's common government, in which its ministers were appointed by the Monarch and responsible to him, had the responsibility for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|army]], for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|navy]], for foreign policy, and for the [[customs union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1974&quot;/&gt; Due to the lack of common law between Austria and Hungary, to conclude identical texts, each parliament elected 60 of its members to form a delegation that discussed motions of the Imperial and Royal ministries separately and worked towards a compromise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1964&quot;/&gt;

A common Ministerial Council ruled the common government: it comprised the three ministers for the joint responsibilities (joint finance, military, and foreign policy), the two prime ministers, some Archdukes and the monarch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sked 1989&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sked|1989|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two delegations of representatives (60–60 members), one each from the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, met separately and voted on the expenditures of the Common Ministerial Council giving the two governments influence in the common administration. However, the ministers ultimately answered only to the monarch who had the final decision on matters of foreign and military policy.

Overlapping responsibilities between the joint ministries and the ministries of the two halves caused friction and inefficiencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1964&quot;/&gt; The armed forces suffered particularly from overlap. Although the unified government determined the overall military direction, the Austrian and Hungarian governments each remained in charge of recruiting, supplies and training. Each government could have a strong influence over common governmental responsibilities. Each half of the Dual Monarchy proved quite prepared to disrupt common operations to advance its own interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sked 1989&quot;/&gt;

Relations during the half-century after 1867 between the two parts of the dual monarchy featured repeated disputes over shared external tariff arrangements and over the financial contribution of each government to the common treasury. Under the terms of the &quot;Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867&quot;, an agreement renegotiated every ten years, determined these matters. There was political turmoil during the build-up to each renewal of the agreement. The disputes culminated in the early 1900s in a prolonged [[constitutional crisis]]. It was triggered by disagreement over which language to use for command in [[Military of Hungary|Hungarian army]] units, and deepened by the advent to power in Budapest in April 1906 of a Hungarian nationalist coalition. Provisional renewals of the common arrangements occurred in October 1907 and in November 1917 on the basis of the ''status quo''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1964&quot;/&gt;

====Kingdom of Hungary====

The judicial power was independent of the administrative power. After 1868 ([[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]]), Croatia-Slavonia had its own independent judicial system (the Table of Seven was the court of last instance for Croatia-Slavonia with final civil and criminal jurisdiction). The judicial authorities in Hungary were:
# the district courts with single judges (458 in 1905);
# the county courts with collegiate judgeships (76 in number); to these were attached 15 jury courts for press offences. These were courts of first instance. In Croatia-Slavonia these were known as the court tables after 1874;
# Royal Tables (12 in number), which were courts of second instance, established at Budapest, Debrecen, Győr, Kassa, Kolozsvár, Marosvásárhely, Nagyvárad, Pécs, Pressburg, Szeged, Temesvár and Ban's Table at Zagreb.
# The Royal Supreme Court at Budapest, and the Supreme Court of Justice, or Table of Seven, at Zagreb, which were the highest judicial authorities. There were also a special commercial court at Budapest, a naval court at Fiume, and special army courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1911&quot;/&gt;

===Public administration and local governments===

====Empire of Austria====
[[File:Otevření mostu 14. 6. 1904.jpg|thumb|Emperor Franz Joseph I visiting [[Prague]] and opening the new Emperor Francis I Bridge in 1901]]
[[File:Rząca Tadeusz, Rynek Główny w Krakowie.jpg|thumb|[[Kraków]], a historical Polish city in the Austro-Hungarian Empire where in 1870 authorities allowed the use of the Polish language in the [[Jagiellonian University]]]]
The organization of the administrative system in the Austrian Empire was complicated by the fact that between the State and the purely local communal administration there intruded yet a third element, grounded in history, the territories (Länder). The State administration comprised all affairs having relation to rights, duties and interests &quot;which are common to all territories&quot;; all other administrative tasks were left to the territories. Finally, the communes had self-government within their own sphere.

To this division of the work of administration corresponded a three-fold organization of the authorities: State, territorial and communal. The State authorities were divided on geographical lines into central, intermediate and local, and side by side with this there was a division of the offices for the transaction of business according to the various branches of the administration. The central authorities, which as early as the 18th century worked together in a common mother cell of the State chancery, became differentiated so soon as the growing tasks of administration called for specialization; in 1869 there were seven departments, and in the concluding decade of the Austrian Empire there were set up Ministries of Labour, Food, Public Health and Social Care. Under these ministries came the Statthalter, whose administrative area had ordinarily the proportions of a Crown territory (Kronland); but the immense variations in area of the Crown territories made a uniform and consistent intermediate administrative organization practically impossible. The lowest administrative unit was the political sub-district (''Bezirk'') under an official (''Bezirkshauptmann''), who united nearly all the administrative functions which were divided among the various ministries according to their attributions.

Side by side with the State administration certain Crown territory administrations also existed in the 17 Crown territories, carried on by selected honorary officials, having under them a staff of professional officials. Many branches of the territorial administration had great similarities with those of the State, so that their spheres of activity frequently overlapped and came into collision. This administrative &quot;double track&quot;, as it was called, led, it is true, in many cases to lively emulation, but was on the whole highly extravagant. The evils of this complicated system are obvious, and easy to condemn. They can be explained, partly by the origin of the State – for the most part through a voluntary union of countries possessed by a strong sense of their own individuality – partly by the influence in Austria of the Germanic spirit, well understood by the Slavs, which has nothing of the Latin tendency to reduce all questions of administration to clear-cut formulae as part of a logically consistent system. Like the English administrative system, the Austrian presented a rich variety, a variety indeed so rich that it clamoured for drastic reform.

Bienerth's last act as premier in May 1911 was the appointment of a commission nominated by the Emperor, to draw up a scheme of administrative reform. So early as 1904 Korber had declared a complete change in the principles of administration to be essential if the machinery of State were to continue working. After seven years of inaction, however, this imperial rescript was pitched in a far lower key. The continuous progress of society, it said, had made increased demands on the administration, that is to say, it was assumed that reform was not demanded so much by the defects of the administration but by the progress of the times, not because the administration was bad, but because life was better. It was an attempt to reform the administration without first reforming the State on equivalent lines.

A reform commission without a programme naturally first occupied itself with reforms about which there was no controversy. After a year had gone by it drew up &quot;Proposals for the training of State officials&quot;. After another two years it had indeed brought to light carefully prepared material for study, which was of great scientific value; but its proposals. though politically of importance, did not provide any basis for reform on a large scale. And so when the World War broke out the commission dispersed without practical results, leaving behind it an imposing array of folio volumes of great scientific value. It was not till March 1918 that the Seidler Government decided upon a programme of national autonomy as a basis for administrative reform, which was, however, never carried into effect.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Austrian Empire&quot; article of ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kingdom of Hungary====

=====Administrative divisions and the counties of Hungary=====
[[File:Ferenc József koronázása Budán.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|Coronation]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] and [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elisabeth Amalie]] at [[Matthias Church]], [[Buda]], 8 June 1867]]
From 1867 the administrative and political divisions of the lands belonging to the Hungarian crown were in great measure remodelled. In 1868 Transylvania was definitely reunited to Hungary proper, and the town and district of Fiume declared autonomous. In 1873 part of the &quot;Military Frontier&quot; was united with Hungary proper and part with Croatia-Slavonia. Hungary proper, according to ancient usage, was generally divided into four great divisions or circles, and Transylvania up to 1876 was regarded as the fifth. In 1876 a general system of counties was introduced. According to this division Hungary proper is divided into seven circles, of which Transylvania forms one. The whole country is divided into the following counties:

(a) The circle on the left bank of the Danube contains eleven counties: (1) Árva, (2) Bars, (3) Esztergom, (4) Hont, (5) Liptó, (6) Nógrád, (7) Nyitra, (8) Pozsony (9) Trencsén, (10) Túrócz and (11) Zólyom.

(b) The circle on the right bank of the Danube contains eleven counties: Baranya, Fejér, Győr, Komárom, Moson, Somogy, Sopron, Tolna, Vas, Veszprém and Zala.

(c) The circle between the Danube and Tisza contains five counties: Bács-Bodrog, Csongrád, Heves, Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok and Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun.

(d) The circle on the right bank of the Tisza contains eight counties: Abaúj-Torna, Bereg, Borsod, Gömör-es Kis-Hont, Sáros, Szepes, Ung, Zemplén.

(e) The circle on the left bank of the Tisza contains eight counties: Békés, Bihar, Hajdú, Máramaros, Szabolcs, Szatmár, Szilágy and Ugocsa.

(f) The circle between the Tisza and the Maros contains five counties: Arad, Csanád, Krassó-Szörény, Temes and Torontál.

(g) Transylvania contains fifteen counties: Also-Fehér, Besztercze-Naszód, Brassó, Csík, Fogaras, Háromszek, Hunyad, Kis-Küküllő, Kolozs, Maros-Torda, Nagy-Küküllő, Szeben, Szolnok-Doboka, Torda-Aranyos and Udvarhely.

Fiume town and district forms a separate division.

Croatia-Slavonia is divided into eight counties: Bjelovar-Križevci, Lika-Krbava, Modrus-Fiume, Pozega, Srijemska, Varaždin, Virovitica and Zagreb.

=====Municipal rights of the biggest cities in Hungary=====

In regard to local government, the country was divided into municipalities or counties, which possessed a certain amount of self-government. Hungary proper was divided into sixty-three rural, and—including Fiume—twenty-six urban municipalities (see section on Administrative Divisions). These urban municipalities were towns which for their local government were independent of the counties in which they were situated, and have, therefore, a larger amount of municipal autonomy than the communes or the other towns. The administration of the municipalities is carried on by an official appointed by the king, aided by a representative body. Since 1876 each municipality had a council of twenty members to exercise control over its administration. According to this division Hungary proper is divided into seven circles.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1911&quot;/&gt;

Besides these sixty-three rural counties for Hungary, and eight for Croatia-Slavonia, Hungary had twenty-six urban counties or towns with municipal rights. These were: Arad, Baja, Debreczen, Győr, Hódmezővásárhely, Kassa, Kecskemét, Kolozsvár, Komárom, Marosvásárhely, Nagyvárad, Pancsova, Pécs, Pozsony, Selmecz- és Bélabanya, Sopron, Szabadka, Szatmárnémeti, Szeged, Székesfehervár, Temesvár, Újvidék, Versecz, Zombor, the town of Fiume and Budapest, the capital of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1911&quot;/&gt;

In Croatia-Slavonia there are four urban counties or towns with municipal rights namely: Osijek, Varaždin and Zagreb and Zemun.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1911&quot;/&gt;

The first prime minister of Hungary after the Compromise was Count [[Gyula Andrássy]] (1867–1871). The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph was crowned as King of Hungary. Andrássy next served as the Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary (1871–1879).

The Empire relied increasingly on a cosmopolitan bureaucracy—in which Czechs played an important role—backed by loyal elements, including a large part of the German, Hungarian, Polish and Croat aristocracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Analysis: Austria's troubled history&quot;/&gt;

===Political struggles in the Empire===

The traditional aristocracy and land-based gentry class gradually faced increasingly wealthy men of the cities, who achieved wealth through trade and industrialization. The urban middle and upper class tended to seek their own power and supported progressive movements in the aftermath of revolutions in Europe.

As in the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire frequently used liberal economic policies and practices. From the 1860s, businessmen succeeded in industrializing parts of the Empire. Newly prosperous members of the [[bourgeoisie]] erected large homes, and began to take prominent roles in urban life that rivaled the aristocracy's. In the early period, they encouraged the government to seek foreign investment to build up infrastructure, such as railroads, in aid of industrialization, transportation and communications, and development.
[[File:Manifestace za hlasovací právo 1905.jpg|thumb|Demonstration for [[Universal suffrage|universal right to vote]] in Prague, Bohemia, 1905]]

The influence of liberals in Austria, most of them ethnic Germans, weakened under the leadership of [[Eduard Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe|Count Eduard von Taaffe]], the Austrian prime minister from 1879 to 1893. Taaffe used a coalition of clergy, conservatives and Slavic parties to weaken the liberals. In [[Bohemia]], for example, he authorized [[Czech language|Czech]] as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system, thus breaking the German speakers' monopoly on holding office. Such reforms encouraged other ethnic groups to push for greater autonomy as well. By playing nationalities off one another, the government ensured the monarchy's central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change.

During the First World War, rising national sentiments and labour movements contributed to strikes, protests and civil unrest in the Empire. After the war, republican, national parties contributed to the disintegration and collapse of the monarchy in Austria and Hungary. Republics were established in Vienna and Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aviel Roshwald|title=Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914–23|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ba97xyhIZDcC&amp;pg=PA116|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=116|isbn=9780203187722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation to help the working class emerged from Catholic conservatives. They turned to social reform by using Swiss and German models and intervening in private industry.  In Germany Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had used such policies to neutralize socialist promises. The Catholics studied the Swiss Factory Act of 1877 that limited working hours for everyone, and gave maternity benefits, and German laws that insured workers against industrial risks inherent in the workplace. These served as the basis for Austria's 1885 Trade Code Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Margarete Grandner, &quot;Conservative Social Politics in Austria, 1880–1890.&quot; ''Austrian History Yearbook'' 27 (1996): 77–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dominance of ethnic minority elected liberal parties in the Hungarian Parliament====

The [[Austro-Hungarian compromise]] and its supporters remained bitterly unpopular among the ethnic Hungarian voters, and the continuous electoral success of the pro-compromise [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]] frustrated many Hungarian voters. While the pro-compromise liberal parties were the most popular among ethnic minority voters, however the Slovak, Serb, and Romanian minority parties remained unpopular among the ethnic minorities. The nationalist Hungarian parties - which were supported by the overwhelming majority of ethnic Hungarian voters - remained in the opposition, except from 1906-1910 where the nationalist Hungarian parties were able to form government. &lt;ref&gt;prof.

In July 1849, the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament proclaimed and enacted ethnic and minority rights (the next such laws were in Switzerland), but these were overturned after the Russian and Austrian armies crushed the Hungarian Revolution. After the Kingdom of Hungary reached the Compromise with the Habsburg Dynasty in 1867, one of the first acts of its restored Parliament was to pass a Law on Nationalities (Act Number XLIV of 1868). It was a liberal piece of legislation, and offered extensive language and cultural rights. It did not recognize non-Hungarians to have rights to form states with any territorial autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;suedosteuropa-gesellschaft&quot;/&gt;

The &quot;Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867&quot; created the personal union of the independent states of Hungary and Austria, linked under a common monarch also having joint institutions. The Hungarian majority asserted more of their identity within the Kingdom of Hungary, and it came to conflict with some of her own minorities. The imperial power of German speakers who controlled the Austrian half was resented by others.  In addition, the emergence of nationalism in the newly independent Romania and Serbia also contributed to ethnic issues in the empire.

Article 19 of the 1867 &quot;Basic State Act&quot; (''Staatsgrundgesetz''), valid only for the Cisleithanian (Austrian) part of Austria-Hungary,&lt;ref name=&quot;verfassungen&quot;/&gt; said:
{{quote|All races of the empire have equal rights, and every race has an inviolable right to the preservation and use of its own nationality and language. The equality of all customary languages (&quot;{{lang|de|landesübliche Sprachen}}&quot;) in school, office and public life, is recognized by the state. In those territories in which several races dwell, the public and educational institutions are to be so arranged that, without applying compulsion to learn a second country language (&quot;{{lang|de|Landessprache}}&quot;), each of the races receives the necessary means of education in its own language.{{sfn|Headlam|1911|p=39}}}}

The implementation of this principle led to several disputes, as it was not clear which languages could be regarded as &quot;customary&quot;. The Germans, the traditional bureaucratic, capitalist and cultural elite, demanded the recognition of their language as a customary language in every part of the empire. German nationalists, especially in the [[Sudetenland]] (part of Bohemia), looked to Berlin in the new German Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Wank and Barbara Jelavich, &quot;The Impact of the Dual Alliance on the Germans in Austria and Vice-Versa,&quot; ''East Central Europe'' (1980) 7#2 pp 288–309&lt;/ref&gt;   There was a German-speaking element in Austria proper (west of Vienna), but it did not display much sense of German nationalism. That is, it did not demand an independent state; rather it flourished by holding most of the high military and diplomatic offices in the Empire.

Italian was regarded as an old &quot;culture language&quot; (''{{lang|de|Kultursprache}}'') by German intellectuals and had always been granted [[Social equality|equal rights]] as an [[official language]] of the Empire, but the Germans had difficulty in accepting the [[Slavic languages]] as equal to their own. On one occasion [[Count Anton Alexander von Auersperg|Count A. Auersperg]] (Anastasius Grün) entered the Diet of [[Carniola]] carrying what he claimed to be the whole [[text corpus|corpus]] of [[Slovene literature]] under his arm; this was to demonstrate that the [[Slovene language]] could not be substituted for German as the language of higher education.

The following years saw official recognition of several languages, at least in Austria. From 1867, laws awarded [[Croatian language|Croatian]] equal status with Italian in [[Dalmatia]]. From 1882, there was a Slovene majority in the Diet of Carniola and in the capital [[Ljubljana|Laibach (Ljubljana)]]; they replaced German with Slovene as their primary official language. [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] designated Polish instead of German in 1869 as the customary language of government.

The language disputes were most fiercely fought in [[Bohemia]], where the Czech speakers formed a majority and sought equal status for their language to German. The [[Czechs]] had lived primarily in [[Bohemia]] since the 6th century and German immigrants had begun settling the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century. The constitution of 1627 made the German language a second official language and equal to Czech. German speakers lost their majority in the Bohemian Diet in 1880 and became a minority to Czech speakers in the cities of [[Prague]] and [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] (while retaining a slight numerical majority in the city of [[Brno|Brno (Brünn)]]). The old [[Charles University in Prague]], hitherto dominated by German speakers, was divided into German and Czech-speaking faculties in 1882.

At the same time, Hungarian dominance faced challenges from the local majorities of [[Romanians]] in [[Transylvania]] and in the eastern [[Banat]], [[Slovaks]] in today's [[Slovakia]], and [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] in the crown lands of [[Croatia]] and of [[Dalmatia]] (today's Croatia), in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and in the provinces known as the [[Vojvodina]] (today's northern [[Serbia]]). The Romanians and the Serbs began to agitate for union with their fellow nationalists and language speakers in the newly founded states of [[Romania]] (1859–1878) and Serbia.

Hungary's leaders were generally less willing than their Austrian counterparts to share power with their subject minorities, but they granted a large measure of autonomy to [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia]] in 1868. To some extent, they modeled their relationship to that kingdom on their own compromise with Austria of the previous year. In spite of nominal autonomy, the Croatian government was an economic and administrative part of Hungary, which the Croatians resented. In the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] and Bosnia and Herzegovina many advocated the idea of a [[Trialism in Austria-Hungary|trialist Austro-Hungaro-Croatian]] monarchy; among the supporters of the idea were [[Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria|Archduke Leopold Salvator]], [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and emperor and king [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] who during his short reign supported the trialist idea only to be vetoed by the Hungarian government and Count [[Istvan Tisza]]. The count finally signed the trialist proclamation after heavy pressure from the king on 23 October 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budisavljević&quot;&gt;Budisavljević, Srđan, ''Stvaranje-Države-SHS, Creation of the state of SHS'', Zagreb, 1958, p.&amp;nbsp;132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language was one of the most contentious issues in Austro-Hungarian politics. All governments faced difficult and divisive hurdles in deciding on the languages of government and of instruction. The minorities sought the widest opportunities for education in their own languages, as well as in the &quot;dominant&quot; languages—Hungarian and German. By the &quot;Ordinance of 5 April 1897&quot;, the Austrian Prime Minister [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni]] gave Czech equal standing with German in the internal government of [[Bohemia]]; this led to a crisis because of nationalist German agitation throughout the empire. The Crown dismissed Badeni.

The Hungarian Minority Act of 1868 gave the minorities (Slovaks, Romanians, Serbs, et al.) individual (but not also communal) rights to use their language in offices, schools (although in practice often only in those founded by them and not by the state), courts and municipalities (if 20% of the deputies demanded it). From June 1907, all public and [[private school]]s in Hungary were obliged to ensure that [[Magyarization|after the fourth grade, the pupils could express themselves fluently in Hungarian]]. This led to the closing of several minority schools, devoted mostly to the Slovak and Rusyn languages.

The two kingdoms sometimes divided their [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. According to [[Misha Glenny]] in his book, ''The Balkans, 1804–1999'', the Austrians responded to Hungarian support of Czechs by supporting the Croatian national movement in [[Zagreb]].

In recognition that he reigned in a multi-ethnic country, Emperor Franz Joseph spoke (and used) German, Hungarian and Czech fluently, and Croatian, Serbian, Polish and Italian to some degree.

====Jews====
[[File:Orthodox Jews in Leopoldstadt 1915.JPG|thumb|Orthodox Jews from Galicia in [[Leopoldstadt]], Vienna, 1915]]
Around 1900, Jews numbered about two million in the whole territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vital|first1=David|title=A People Apart: A Political History of the Jews in Europe 1789–1939|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=299|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZmSV0c0f5MC&amp;pg=PA299|isbn=978-0198219804}}&lt;/ref&gt; their position was ambiguous. The [[populism|populist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] politics of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] are sometimes viewed as a model for [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;Fareed Zacharia, ''The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad'', Norton, 2003, 2007, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic parties and movements existed, but the governments of Vienna and Budapest did not initiate [[pogroms]] or implement official antisemitic policies.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} They feared that such [[ethnic violence]] could ignite other [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] and escalate out of control. The antisemitic parties remained on the periphery of the political sphere due to their low popularity among voters in the parliamentary elections.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In that period, the majority of Jews in Austria-Hungary lived in small towns (''[[shtetls]]'') in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and rural areas in Hungary and Bohemia; however, they had large communities and even local majorities in the downtown districts of Vienna, Budapest and Prague. Of the pre-World War I military forces of the major European powers, the Austro-Hungarian army was almost alone in its regular promotion of Jews to positions of command.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1976|p=118}} While the Jewish population of the lands of the Dual Monarchy was about five percent, Jews made up nearly eighteen percent of the reserve officer corps.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1976|p=128}} Thanks to the modernity of the constitution and to the benevolence of emperor Franz Joseph, the Austrian Jews came to regard the era of Austria-Hungary as a golden era of their history.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Wyman, Charles H. Rosenzveig: ''The World Reacts to the Holocaust''. (page 474)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910 about 900,000 religious Jews made up approximately 5% of the population of Hungary and about 23% of Budapest's citizenry. Jews accounted for 54% of commercial business owners, 85% of financial institution directors and owners in banking, and 62% of all employees in commerce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/hungary/25.htm|title=Hungary – Social Changes|publisher=Countrystudies.us|access-date=19 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014133338/http://countrystudies.us/hungary/25.htm|archive-date=14 October 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20% of all general grammar school students, and 37% of all commercial scientific grammar school students, 31.9% of all engineering students, and 34.1% of all students in human faculties of the universities.

===Foreign policy===

{{see also|International relations (1814–1919)|Foreign Ministry of Austria-Hungary}}
[[File:Sarajevo 1878..jpg|thumb|right|Bosnian Muslim resistance during the battle of Sarajevo in 1878 against the [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation]]]]
The minister of foreign affairs conducted the foreign relations of the Dual Monarchy, and negotiated treaties.&lt;ref&gt;F.R. Bridge, ''From Sadowa to Sarajevo: The Foreign Policy of Austria-Hungary 1866–1914'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dual Monarchy was created in the wake of a losing war in 1866 with Prussia and Italy. To rebuild Habsburg prestige and gain revenge against Prussia, [[Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust]] became foreign secretary. He hated Prussia's diplomat, [[Otto von Bismarck]], who had repeatedly outmaneuvered him. Beust looked to France and negotiated with Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and Italy for an anti-Prussian alliance. No terms could be reached. The decisive victory of Prusso-German armies in the war of 1870 with France and the founding of the German Empire ended all hope of revenge and Beust retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=4545476|title=Count Beust and Germany, 1866-1870: Reconquest, Realignment, or Resignation?|journal=Central European History|volume=1|issue=1|pages=20–34|last1=Schmitt|first1=Hans A.|year=1968|doi=10.1017/S000893890001476X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being forced out of Germany and Italy, the Dual Monarchy turned to the Balkans, which were in tumult as nationalistic efforts were trying to end the rule of the Ottomans. Both Russia and Austria-Hungary saw an opportunity to expand in this region. Russia in particular took on the role of protector of Slavs and Orthodox Christians. Austria envisioned a multi-ethnic, religiously diverse empire under Vienna's control. Count [[Gyula Andrássy]], a Hungarian who was Foreign Minister (1871 to 1879), made the centerpiece of his policy one of opposition to Russian expansion in the Balkans and blocking Serbian ambitions to dominate a new South Slav federation.

When Russia defeated Turkey in a war the resulting [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was seen in Austria as much too favourable for Russia and its Orthodox-Slavic goals. The [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 let Austria occupy (but not annex) the province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a predominantly Slavic area. In 1914, Slavic militants in Bosnia rejected Austria's plan to fully absorb the area; they [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated the Austrian heir]] and precipitated World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, ''European Alliances and Alignments: 1871–1890'' pp. 138, 155–6, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting rights===
Towards the end of the 19th century, the Austrian half of the dual monarchy began to move towards [[constitutionalism]]. A constitutional system with a parliament, the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]] was created, and a bill of rights was enacted also in 1867. Suffrage to the Reichstag's [[House of Deputies (Austria)|lower house]] was gradually expanded until 1907, when equal suffrage for all male citizens was introduced. 

The [[1907 Cisleithanian legislative election]] were the first elections held under [[Universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]], after an electoral reform abolishing tax paying requirements for voters had been adopted by the Council and was endorsed by Emperor Franz Joseph earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=NS1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p.184 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, seat allocations were based on tax revenues from the States.&lt;ref name=NS1/&gt;

The Austro-Hungarian economy changed dramatically during the Dual Monarchy. The [[capitalism|capitalist]] way of production spread throughout the Empire during its 50-year existences. [[Technological change]] accelerated [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. The first Austrian stock exchange (the [[Wiener Börse]]) was opened in 1771 in Vienna, the first stock exchange of the Kingdom of Hungary (the [[Budapest Stock Exchange]]) was opened in Budapest in 1864. The [[central bank]] (Bank of issue) was founded as Austrian National Bank in 1816. In 1878, it transformed into Austro-Hungarian National Bank with principal offices in both Vienna and Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Barcsay|title=Banking in Hungarian Economic Development, 1867–1919|publisher=Ryeson Polytechnical Institute|year=1991|page=216|url=http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHprint/v020/p0216-p0225.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117205044/http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHprint/v020/p0216-p0225.pdf|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=dead|access-date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central bank was governed by alternating Austrian or Hungarian governors and vice-governors.&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Sugar, Péter Hanák: A History of Hungary (Publisher: Indiana University Press) Page: 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] per capita grew roughly 1.76% per year from 1870 to 1913. That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%).&lt;ref name=&quot;economic&quot;/&gt; However, in a comparison with Germany and Britain, the Austro-Hungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later. Like the German Empire, that of Austria-Hungary frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices. In 1873, the old Hungarian capital Buda and Óbuda (Ancient Buda) were officially merged with the third city, Pest, thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into Hungary's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period. Economic growth centered on Vienna and Budapest, the Austrian lands (areas of modern Austria), the Alpine region and the Bohemian lands. In the later years of the 19th century, rapid economic growth spread to the central [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plain]] and to the Carpathian lands. As a result, wide disparities of development existed within the empire. In general, the western areas became more developed than the eastern. The Kingdom of Hungary became the world's second largest flour exporter after the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Max-Stephan Schulze|title=Engineering and Economic Growth: The Development of Austria-Hungary's Machine-Building Industry in the Late Nineteenth Century|publisher=Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang|year=1996|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large Hungarian food exports were not limited to neighbouring Germany and Italy: Hungary became the most important foreign food supplier of the large cities and industrial centres of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Commercial Relations of the United States: Reports from the Consuls of the United States on the Commerce, Manufactures, Etc., of Their Consular Districts. Publisher: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1881 (page: 371)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the end of the 19th century, economic differences gradually began to even out as economic growth in the eastern parts of the monarchy consistently surpassed that in the western. The strong agriculture and [[food industry]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] with the centre of [[Budapest]] became predominant within the empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around [[Prague]] and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This [[division of labour]] between the east and west, besides the existing [[economic and monetary union]], led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria-Hungary by the early 20th century. However, since the turn of the twentieth century, the Austrian half of the Monarchy could preserve its dominance within the empire in the sectors of the [[first industrial revolution]], but Hungary had a better position in the industries of the [[second industrial revolution]], in these modern sectors of the second industrial revolution the Austrian competition could not become dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Iván T.|last=Berend|author-link=Iván T.

The empire's [[heavy industry]] had mostly focused on machine building, especially for the [[electric power industry]], [[History of rail transport|locomotive industry]] and [[automotive industry]], while in [[light industry]] the [[precision mechanics]] industry was the most dominant. Through the years leading up to [[World War I]] the country became the 4th biggest machine manufacturer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The two most important trading partners were traditionally Germany (1910: 48% of all exports, 39% of all imports), and Great Britain (1910: almost 10% of all exports, 8% of all imports), the third most important partner was the United States, it followed by Russia, France, Switzerland, Romania, the Balkan states and South America.&lt;ref name=ah1911/&gt; Trade with the geographically neighbouring Russia, however, had a relatively low weight (1910: 3% of all exports /mainly machinery for Russia, 7% of all imports /mainly raw materials from Russia).

===Automotive industry===
Prior to World War I, the Austrian Empire had five car manufacturer companies.

{{Main|Imperial Austrian State Railways|Hungarian State Railways}}

By 1913, the combined length of the railway tracks of the Austrian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary reached {{convert|43,280|km|abbr=off}}. In [[Western Europe]] only Germany had more extended railway network ({{cvt|63,378|km|disp=comma}}); the Austro-Hungarian Empire was followed by France ({{cvt|40,770|km|disp=comma}}), the United Kingdom ({{cvt|32,623|km|disp=comma}}), Italy ({{cvt|18,873|km|disp=comma}}) and Spain ({{cvt|15,088|km|disp=comma}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broadberry|first1=Stephen|last2=O'Rourke|first2=Kevin H.|title=The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe: Volume 2, 1870 to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|page=80|isbn=9781139489515|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHk0z-ujS3AC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Telephone+calls+in+1913#v=onepage&amp;q=Telephone%20calls%20in%201913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Railway network of the Austrian Empire=====

[[Rail transport]] expanded rapidly in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its [[predecessor state]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], had built a substantial core of railways in the west, originating from Vienna, by 1841. Austria's [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway|first steam railway]] from Vienna to [[Moravia]] with its terminus in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (Bochnie) was opened in 1839. The first train travelled from Vienna to Lundenburg (Břeclav) on 6 June 1839 and one month later between the imperial capital in Vienna and the capital of Moravia [[Brno|Brünn]] (Brno) on 7 July. At that point, the government realized the military possibilities of rail and began to invest heavily in construction. [[Pozsony]] ([[Bratislava]]), [[Budapest]], [[Prague]], [[Kraków]], [[Graz]], Laibach ([[Ljubljana]]) and [[Venice|Venedig]] ([[Venice]]) became linked to the main network. By 1854, the empire had almost {{convert|2000|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of track, about 60–70% of it in state hands. The government then began to sell off large portions of track to private investors to recoup some of its investments and because of the financial strains of the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Revolution]] and of the [[Crimean War]].

From 1854 to 1879, private interests conducted almost all rail construction. What would become Cisleithania gained {{convert|7952|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of track, and Hungary built {{convert|5839|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of track. During this time, many new areas joined the railway system and the existing rail networks gained connections and interconnections. This period marked the beginning of widespread rail transportation in Austria-Hungary, and also the integration of transportation systems in the area. Railways allowed the empire to integrate its economy far more than previously possible, when transportation depended on rivers.

After 1879, the Austrian and the Hungarian governments slowly began to renationalize their rail networks, largely because of the sluggish pace of development during the worldwide [[depression (economics)|depression]] of the 1870s. Between 1879 and 1900, more than {{convert|25000|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of railways were built in Cisleithania and Hungary. Most of this constituted &quot;filling in&quot; of the existing network, although some areas, primarily in the far east, gained rail connections for the first time. The railway reduced transportation costs throughout the empire, opening new markets for products from other lands of the Dual Monarchy. In 1914, of a total of {{convert|22981|km|2|sp=us|abbr=on}} of railway tracks in Austria, {{convert|18859|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} (82%) were state owned.

=====Railway network in the Kingdom of Hungary=====

The first Hungarian steam locomotive railway line was opened on 15 July 1846 between [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[Vác]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikulas Teich]], [[Roy Porter]], ''The Industrial Revolution in National Context: Europe and the USA'', p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 most large Hungarian private railway companies were nationalized as a consequence of the poor management of private companies, except the strong Austrian-owned Kaschau-Oderberg Railway (KsOd) and the Austrian-Hungarian Southern Railway (SB/DV). They also joined the zone tariff system of the MÁV (Hungarian State Railways). By 1910, the total length of the rail networks of Hungarian Kingdom reached {{convert|22,869|km|abbr=off}}, the Hungarian network linked more than 1,490 settlements. Nearly half (52%) of the empire's railways were built in Hungary, thus the railroad density there became higher than that of Cisleithania. This has ranked Hungarian railways the 6th most dense in the world (ahead of countries as Germany or France).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a9csmhIT_BQC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22steel+output%22+%22austria-hungary%22|title=History Derailed: Central and Eastern Europe in the Long Nineteenth Century|author=Iván T.

=====Tramway lines in the cities=====

[[Horse-drawn tramway]]s appeared in the first half of the 19th century. Between the 1850s and 1880s many were built. [[Vienna]] (1865), Budapest (1866), Brno (1869). Steam trams appeared in the late 1860s. The electrification of tramways started from the late 1880s. The first electrified tramway in Austria-Hungary was built in Budapest in 1887.

=====Underground=====

The [[Budapest Metro|Budapest metro]] Line 1 (originally the &quot;Franz Joseph Underground Electric Railway Company&quot;) is the second oldest underground railway in the world&lt;ref&gt;Kogan Page: ''Europe Review 2003/2004'', fifth edition, Wolden Publishing Ltd, 2003, [https://books.google.com/?id=Hwi0s3I5jLEC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=%22The+world%27s+second-oldest+undergound%2Fmetro+system+after+London+is+identified+by+large%22 page 174]&lt;/ref&gt; (the first being the London Underground's Metropolitan Line and the third being Glasgow), and the first on the European mainland.

====Canals and river regulations====

In 1900 the engineer C. Wagenführer drew up plans to link the [[Danube]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] by a canal from Vienna to Trieste. It was born from the desire of Austria-Hungary to have a direct link to the Adriatic Sea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.mgml.si/media/katalog_9_5.pdf|title=Emona: Myth and Reality|first=Irena|last=Žmuc|page=63|chapter=Sustained Interest|publisher=Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana; City Museum of Ljubljana|editor-first=Bernarda|editor-last=Županek|year=2010|isbn=9789616509206|access-date=19 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105154411/http://www.mgml.si/media/katalog_9_5.pdf|archive-date=5 November 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was never constructed.

=====Regulation of the lower Danube and the Iron Gates=====

In 1831 a plan had already been drafted to make the passage navigable, at the initiative of the Hungarian politician [[István Széchenyi]]. Finally [[Gábor Baross]], Hungary's &quot;Iron Minister&quot;, succeeded in financing this project. The riverbed rocks and the associated rapids made the gorge valley an infamous passage for shipping. In German, the passage is still known as the Kataraktenstrecke, even though the cataracts are gone. Near the actual &quot;[[Iron Gates]]&quot; strait the Prigrada rock was the most important obstacle until 1896: the river widened considerably here and the water level was consequently low. Upstream, the Greben rock near the &quot;Kazan&quot; gorge was notorious.

=====Regulation of the Tisza River=====

The length of the [[Tisza]] in Hungary used to be {{convert|1419|km|abbr=off}}. It flowed through the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], which is one of the largest flat areas in central Europe. Since plains can cause a river to flow very slowly, the Tisza used to follow a path with many curves and turns, which led to many large floods in the area.

After several small-scale attempts, István Széchenyi organised the &quot;regulation of the Tisza&quot; (Hungarian: a Tisza szabályozása) which started on 27 August 1846, and substantially ended in 1880. The new length of the river in Hungary was {{convert|966|km|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1358|km|abbr=on}} total), with {{convert|589|km|abbr=on}} of &quot;dead channels&quot; and {{convert|136|km|abbr=on}} of new riverbed. The resultant length of the flood-protected river comprises {{convert|2940|km|abbr=on}} (out of {{convert|4220|km|abbr=on}} of all Hungarian protected rivers).

====Shipping and ports====
[[File:Ragusa, the Inner Gate, Dalmatia, Austro-Hungary-LCCN2002710786.jpg|thumb|[[Dubrovnik]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]]]
The first Hungarian steamship was built by Antal Bernhard in 1817, called S.S. ''Carolina''. It was also the first steamship in Habsburg ruled states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisnovszky&quot;&gt;Iván Wisnovszky, [https://books.google.com/?id=iqpTAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Study+trip+to+the+Danube+Bend Study trip to the Danube Bend], Hydraulic Documentation and Information Centre, 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; However it was Count [[István Széchenyi]] (with the help of Austrian ship's company [[Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft|Erste Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft]] (DDSG)), who established the Óbuda Shipyard on the Hungarian [[Hajógyári Island]] in 1835, which was the first industrial scale steamship building company in the Habsburg Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Victor-L. Tapie, ''The Rise and Fall of the Habsburg Monarchy'' p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important seaport was [[Trieste]] (today part of Italy), where the Austrian merchant marine was based. Two major shipping companies (Austrian Lloyd and Austro-Americana) and several shipyards were located there. The k.u.k. navy used the port's shipyards to build new ships for the navy. This port grew as Venice declined. From 1815 to 1866, Venice was included within the monarchy: it was prevented from competing with Austrian-ruled ports. The merchant marine did not develop until Venice's shipping interest declined. The navy became significant during the time of the k.u.k. monarchy as industrialization provided sufficient revenues to develop it.

Another significant seaport was Pola ([[Pula]], today part of Croatia) – especially for the navy. 

The first Danubian steamer company, Donau-Dampfschiffahrt-Gesellschaft (DDSG), was the largest inland shipping company in the world until the collapse of the k.u.k. The Austrian Lloyd was one of the biggest ocean shipping companies of the time. Prior to the beginning of World War I, the company owned 65 middle-sized and large steamers. The Austro-Americana owned one third of them, including the biggest Austrian passenger ship, the SS ''Kaiser Franz Joseph I''. In comparison to the Austrian Lloyd, the Austro-American concentrated on destinations in North and South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;dradio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theshipslist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dame&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aeiou&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;danube&quot;/&gt; 

'''Austria'''

The commercial marine of the former Empire of Austria on January 1, 1913, comprised 16,764 vessels with a tonnage of 471,252, and crews number-ing 45,567. Of the total (1913) 394 of 422,368 tons were steamers, and 16,370 of 48,884 tons were sailing vessels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Scott-Keltie|title=The Statesman's Yearbook|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |year=1919|page=[https://archive.org/details/statesmansyearbo1919londuoft/page/670 670]|url=https://archive.org/details/statesmansyearbo1919londuoft|author-link=John Scott-Keltie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hungary'''

The most important seaport for the Hungarian part of the k.u.k. was Fiume ([[Rijeka]], today part of Croatia), where the Hungarian shipping companies, such as the Adria, operated. The largest Hungarian shipbuilding company was the Ganz-Danubius.

The commercial marine of the former Kingdom of Hungary in 1913 comprised 545 vessels of 144,433 tons, and crews numbering 3,217. Of the total number of vessels 134,000 of 142,539 tons were steamers, and 411 of 1,894 tons were sailing vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Scott-Keltie|title=The Statesman's Yearbook|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year=1919|page=[https://archive.org/details/statesmansyearbo1919londuoft/page/683 683]|url=https://archive.org/details/statesmansyearbo1919londuoft|author-link=John Scott-Keltie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public telephone stations appeared in the 1890s, and they quickly became widespread in post offices and railway stations. Austria-Hungary had 568 million telephone calls in 1913; only two Western European countries had more phone calls: the German Empire and the United Kingdom. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was followed by France with 396 million telephone calls and Italy with 230 million phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;See the above cited book: Stephen Broadberry and Kevin H.

In 1916, there were 366 million telephone calls in the Austrian half of the monarchy, among them 8.4 million long distant calls.&lt;ref&gt;Brousek; Karl M.: ''Die Großindustrie Böhmens 1848–1918'', München: Oldenbourg 1987, {{ISBN|9783486518719}}, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Kingdom of Hungary=====
All telephone exchanges of the cities, towns and larger villages in Kingdom of Hungary were linked until 1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;docs.google.com&quot;/&gt;
By 1914, more than 2000 settlements had telephone exchange in Kingdom of Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kettős kötődés&quot;/&gt;

====Electronic broadcasting====
The [[Telefon Hírmondó]] (Telephone Herald) news and entertainment service was introduced in Budapest in 1893. Two decades before the introduction of radio broadcasting, people could listen to political, economic and sport news, cabaret, music and opera in Budapest daily. It operated over a special type of telephone exchange system.

===Languages===
In Austria (Cisleithania), the census of 1910 recorded ''Umgangssprache'', everyday language. Jews and those using German in offices often stated German as their ''Umgangssprache'', even when having a different ''Muttersprache''. 36.8% of the total population spoke German as their native language, and more than 71% of the inhabitants spoke some German.

In Hungary (Transleithania), the census was based primarily on mother tongue,&lt;ref name=MEK&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02185/html/171.html|title=Magyarország népessége|language=hu|website=mek.oszk.hu|access-date=4 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722182701/http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02185/html/171.html|archive-date=22 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ORIGINAL&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/NEDA_1910_01/?pg=21&amp;layout=s|title=1910.

Not counting autonomous Croatia-Slavonia, more than 54.4% of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Hungary were native speakers of Hungarian (this included also the Jews – around 5% of the population -, as mostly they were Hungarian-speaking).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibl.u-szeged.hu/porta/szint/tarsad/szocio/studia/studia.htm|title=Népszámlálások Erdély területén 1850 és 1910 között|language=hu|website=bibl.u-szeged.hu|access-date=6 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207020351/http://www.bibl.u-szeged.hu/porta/szint/tarsad/szocio/studia/studia.htm|archive-date=7 February 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor&quot;&gt;A.

Note that some languages were considered dialects of more widely spoken languages. For example: in the census, [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]] were counted as &quot;Italian&quot;. [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] was counted as &quot;German&quot; in both Austria and Hungary.

===Education===

====Austrian Empire====
'''Primary and secondary schools'''

The organization of the Austrian elementary schools was based on the principle of compulsory school attendance, free education, and the imparting of public instruction in the child's own language. Side by side with these existed private schools. The proportion of children attending private schools to those attending the public elementary schools in 1912 was 144,000 to 4.5 millions, i.e. a thirtieth part. Hence the accusation of denationalizing children through the Schulvereine must be accepted with caution. The expenses of education were distributed as follows: the communes built the schoolhouses, the political sub-districts (Bezirke) paid the teachers, the Crown territory gave a grant, and the State appointed the inspectors. Since the State supervised the schools without maintaining them, it was able to increase its demands without being hampered by financial considerations. It is remarkable that the difference between the State educational estimates in Austria and in Hungary was one of 9.3 millions in the former as opposed to 67.6 in the latter. Under Austria, since everywhere that 40 scholars of one nationality were to be found within a radius of 5&amp;nbsp;km. a school had to be set up in which their language was used, national schools were assured even to linguistic minorities. It is true that this mostly happened at the expense of the German industrial communities, since the Slav labourers as immigrants acquired schools in their own language. The number of elementary schools increased from 19,016 in two to 24,713 in 1913; the number of scholars from 3,490,000 in 1900 to 4,630,000 in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Empire article of E. Britannica 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universities in Austrian Empire'''

The first University in the Austrian half of the Empire ([[Charles University]]) was founded by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|H.R. Emperor Charles IV]] in Prague in 1347. The second oldest university ([[University of Vienna]]) was founded by [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Duke Rudolph IV]] in 1365.&lt;ref&gt;https://geschichte.univie.ac.at/en/topics/beginnings-alma-mater-rudolphina&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher educational institutions were predominantly German, but beginning in the 1870s, language shifts began to occur.&lt;ref name=StraussPT196&gt;Strauss, Johann. &quot;Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire&quot; (Chapter 7). In: Murphey, Rhoads (editor). ''Imperial Lineages and Legacies in the Eastern Mediterranean: Recording the Imprint of Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Rule'' (Volume 18 of Birmingham Byzantine and Ottoman Studies). Routledge, 7 July 2016. {{ISBN|1317118448}}, 9781317118442. [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=gY-kDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT196 PT196].&lt;/ref&gt; These establishments, which in the middle of the 19th century had had a predominantly German character, underwent in Galicia a conversion into Polish national institutions, in Bohemia and Moravia a separation into German and Czech ones. Thus Germans, Czechs and Poles were provided for. But now the smaller nations also made their voices heard: the Ruthenians, Slovenes and Italians. The Ruthenians demanded at first, in view of the predominantly Ruthenian character of East Galicia, a national partition of the Polish university existing there. Since the Poles were at first unyielding, Ruthenian demonstrations and strikes of students arose, and the Ruthenians were no longer content with the reversion of a few separate professorial chairs, and with parallel courses of lectures. By a pact concluded on 28 January 1914 the Poles promised a Ruthenian university; but owing to the war the question lapsed. The Italians could hardly claim a university of their own on grounds of population (in 19to they numbered 783,000), but they claimed it all the more on grounds of their ancient culture. All parties were agreed that an Italian faculty of laws should be created; the difficulty lay in the choice of the place. The Italians demanded Trieste; but the Government was afraid to let this Adriatic port become the centre of an irredenta; moreover the Southern Slavs of the city wished it kept free from an Italian educational establishment. Bienerth in 1910 brought about a compromise; namely, that it should be founded at once, the situation to be provisionally in Vienna, and to be transferred within four years to Italian national territory. The German National Union (Nationalverband) agreed to extend temporary hospitality to the Italian university in Vienna, but the Southern Slav Hochschule Club demanded a guarantee that a later transfer to the coast provinces should not be contemplated, together with the simultaneous foundation of Slovene professorial chairs in Prague and Cracow, and preliminary steps towards the foundation of a Southern Slav university in Laibach. But in spite of the constant renewal of negotiations for a compromise it was impossible to arrive at any agreement, until the outbreak of war left all the projects for a Ruthenian university at Lemberg, a Slovene one in Laibach, and a second Czech one in Moravia, unrealized.

====Kingdom of Hungary====
'''Primary and secondary schools'''

One of the first measures of newly established Hungarian government was to provide supplementary schools of a non-denominational character. By a law passed in 1868 attendance at school was obligatory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12 years. The communes or parishes were bound to maintain elementary schools, and they were entitled to levy an additional tax of 5% on the state taxes for their maintenance. But the number of state-aided elementary schools was continually increasing, as the spread of the Magyar language to the other races through the medium of the elementary schools was one of the principal concerns of the Hungarian government, and was vigorously pursued. In 1902 there were in Hungary 18,729 elementary schools with 32,020 teachers, attended by 2,573,377 pupils, figures which compare favourably with those of 1877, when there were 15,486 schools with 20,717 teachers, attended by 1,559,636 pupils. In about 61% of these schools the language used was exclusively Magyar, in about 6 20% it was mixed, and in the remainder some non-Magyar language was used. In 1902, 80.56% of the children of school age actually attended school. Since 1891 infant schools, for children between the ages of 3 and 6 years, were maintained either by the communes or by the state.

The public instruction of Hungary contained three other groups of educational institutions: middle or secondary schools, &quot;high schools&quot; and technical schools. The middle schools comprised classical schools (gymnasia) which were preparatory for the universities and other &quot;high schools&quot;, and modern schools (Realschulen) preparatory for the technical schools. Their course of study was generally eight years, and they were maintained mostly by the state. The state-maintained gymnasia were mostly of recent foundation, but some schools maintained by the various churches had been in existence for three or sometimes four centuries. The number of middle schools in 1902 was 243 with 4705 teachers, attended by 71,788 pupils; in 1880 their number was 185, attended by 40,747 pupils.

'''Universities in Kingdom of Hungary'''

In the year 1276, the university of Veszprém was destroyed by the troops of Péter Csák and it was never rebuilt. A university was established by [[Louis I of Hungary]] in Pécs in 1367. Sigismund established a university at Óbuda in 1395. Another, Universitas Istropolitana, was established 1465 in Pozsony (now Bratislava in Slovakia) by [[Mattias Corvinus]]. None of these medieval universities survived the Ottoman wars. Nagyszombat University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it is called Eötvös Loránd University today. The world's first institute of technology was founded in Selmecbánya, Kingdom of Hungary (since 1920 Banská Štiavnica, now Slovakia) in 1735. Its legal successor is the University of Miskolc in Hungary. The Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure. Its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II.

The high schools included the universities, of which Hungary possessed five, all maintained by the state: at Budapest (founded in 1635), at Kolozsvár (founded in 1872), and at Zagreb (founded in 1874). Newer universities were established in Debrecen in 1912, and Pozsony university was reestablished after a half millennium in 1912. They had four faculties: theology, law, philosophy and medicine (the university at Zagreb was without a faculty of medicine). There were in addition ten high schools of law, called academies, which in 1900 were attended by 1569 pupils. The Polytechnicum in Budapest, founded in 1844, which contained four faculties and was attended in 1900 by 1772 pupils, was also considered a high school. There were in Hungary in 1900 forty-nine theological colleges, twenty-nine Catholic, five Greek Uniat, four Greek Orthodox, ten Protestant and one Jewish. Among special schools the principal mining schools were at Selmeczbánya, Nagyág and Felsőbánya; the principal agricultural colleges at Debreczen and Kolozsvár; and there was a school of forestry at Selmeczbánya, military colleges at Budapest, Kassa, Déva and Zagreb, and a naval school at Fiume. There were in addition a number of training institutes for teachers and a large number of schools of commerce, several art schools – for design, painting, sculpture, music.

==Military==

{{main|Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces}}
[[File:KuK Infanterie 1898.jpg|thumb|k.u.k. [[infantry]] in 1898]]

The Army was under the command of [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen]] (1817–1895), an old-fashioned bureaucrat who opposed modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther Rothenburg, ''The Army of Francis Joseph'' (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The military system of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was similar in both states, and rested since 1868 upon the principle of the universal and personal obligation of the citizen to bear arms. Its military force was composed of the [[common army]]; the special armies, namely the [[Austrian Landwehr]], and the [[Hungarian Honved]], which were separate national institutions, and the [[Landsturm]] or levy-en masse. As stated above, the common army stood under the administration of the joint minister of war, while the special armies were under the administration of the respective ministries of national defence. The yearly contingent of recruits for the army was fixed by the military bills voted on by the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, and was generally determined on the basis of the population, according to the last census returns. It amounted in 1905 to 103,100 men, of which Austria furnished 59,211 men, and Hungary 43,889. Besides 10,000 men were annually allotted to the Austrian Landwehr, and 12,500 to the Hungarian Honved. The term of service was two years (three years in the cavalry) with the colours, seven or eight in the reserve and two in the Landwehr; in the case of men not drafted to the active army the same total period of service was spent in various special reserves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Headlam 1911, p. 3&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|last=Headlam|first=James Wycliffe|date=1911b|wstitle=Austria-Hungary|volume=3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common minister of war was the head for the administration of all military affairs, except those of the Austrian Landwehr and of the Hungarian Honved, which were committed to the ministries for national defence of the two respective states. But the supreme command of the army was nominally vested in the monarch, who had the power to take all measures regarding the whole army.  In practice the emperor's nephew Archduke Albrecht was his chief military advisor and made the policy decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Headlam 1911, p. 3&quot;/&gt;

The Austro-Hungarian navy was mainly a coast defence force, and also included a flotilla of monitors for the Danube. It was administered by the naval department of the ministry of war.{{sfn|Headlam|1911b|p=4}}

Russian [[Pan-Slavic]] organizations sent aid to the Balkan rebels and so pressured the tsar's government to declare war on the Ottoman Empire in 1877 in the name of protecting Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1974&quot;/&gt; Unable to mediate between the Ottoman Empire and Russia over the control of Serbia, Austria-Hungary declared neutrality when the conflict between the two powers escalated into a [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|war]]. With help from Romania and Greece, Russia defeated the Ottomans and with the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] tried to create a large pro-Russian Bulgaria. This treaty sparked an international uproar that almost resulted in a general European war. Austria-Hungary and Britain feared that a large Bulgaria would become a Russian satellite that would enable the tsar to dominate the Balkans. British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli moved warships into position against Russia to halt the advance of Russian influence in the eastern Mediterranean so close to Britain's route through the [[Suez Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) CH 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congress of Berlin]] rolled back the Russian victory by partitioning the large Bulgarian state that Russia had carved out of Ottoman territory and denying any part of Bulgaria full independence from the Ottomans. Austria occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina as a way of gaining clout in the Balkans. Serbia, Montenegro and Romania became fully independent. Nonetheless the Balkans remained a site of political unrest with teeming ambition for independence and great power rivalries. At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 [[Gyula Andrássy]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs) managed to force Russia to retreat from further demands in the Balkans. As a result, [[Greater Bulgaria]] was broken up and Serbian independence was guaranteed.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; In that year, with Britain's support, Austria-Hungary stationed troops in Bosnia to prevent the Russians from expanding into nearby Serbia. In another measure to keep the Russians out of the Balkans Austria-Hungary formed an alliance, the Mediterranean Entente, with Britain and Italy in 1887 and concluded mutual defence pacts with Germany in 1879 and Romania in 1883 against a possible Russian attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;webcitation&quot;/&gt; Following the Congress of Berlin the European powers attempted to guarantee stability through a complex series of alliances and treaties.

Anxious about Balkan instability and Russian aggression, and to counter French interests in Europe, Austria-Hungary forged a [[defensive alliance]] with Germany in October 1879 and in May 1882. In October 1882 Italy joined this partnership in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] largely because of Italy's imperial rivalries with France. Tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary remained high, so [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] replaced the [[League of the Three Emperors]] with the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia to keep the Habsburgs from recklessly starting a war over Pan-Slavism.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) pp&amp;nbsp;201–14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sandžak|Sandžak-Raška / Novibazar]] region was under Austro-Hungarian occupation between 1878 and 1909, when it was returned to the [[Ottoman Empire]], before being ultimately divided between kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mount HolyOak&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos128.htm|title=The Austrian Occupation of Novibazar, 1878–1909|publisher=Mount HolyOak|access-date=24 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119180459/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos128.htm|archive-date=19 January 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the heels of the Great Balkan Crisis, Austro-Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 1878 and the monarchy eventually [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908]] as a common holding of Cisleithania and Transleithania under the control of the [[finance minister|Imperial &amp; Royal finance ministry]] rather than attaching it to either territorial government. The annexation in 1908 led some in Vienna to contemplate combining Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia to form a third Slavic component of the monarchy. The deaths of Franz Joseph's brother, [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] (1867), and his only son, [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Rudolf]] made the Emperor's nephew, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], heir to the throne. The Archduke was rumoured to have been an advocate for this trialism as a means to limit the power of the Hungarian aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Status of Bosnia-Herzegovina====

A proclamation issued on the occasion of its annexation to the Habsburg Monarchy in 1908 promised these lands constitutional institutions, which should secure to their inhabitants full civil rights and a share in the management of their own affairs by means of a local representative assembly. In performance of this promise a constitution was promulgated in 1910. This included a Territorial Statute (Landesstatut) with the setting up of a Territorial Diet, regulations for the election and procedure of the Diet, a law of associations, a law of public meetings, and a law dealing with the district councils. According to this statute Bosnia-Herzegovina formed a single administrative territory under the responsible direction and supervision of the Ministry of Finance of the Dual Monarchy in Vienna. The administration of the country, together with the carrying out of the laws, devolved upon the Territorial Government in Sarajevo, which was subordinate and responsible to the Common Ministry of Finance. The existing judicial and administrative authorities of the Territory retained their previous organization and functions. That statute introduced the modern rights and laws in Bosnia – Herzegovina, and it guaranteed generally the civil rights of the inhabitants of the Territory, namely citizenship, personal liberty, protection by the competent judicial authorities, liberty of creed and conscience, preservation of the national individuality and language, freedom of speech, freedom of learning and education, inviolability of the domicile, secrecy of posts and telegraphs, inviolability of property, the right of petition, and finally the right of holding meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) pp&amp;nbsp;259–72&lt;/ref&gt;

The Diet (Sabor) of Bosnia-Herzegovina set up consisted of a single Chamber, elected on the principle of the representation of interests. It numbered 92 members. Of these 20 consisted of representatives of all the religious confessions, the president of the Supreme Court, the president of the Chamber of Advocates, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and the mayor of Sarajevo. In addition to these were 72 deputies, elected by three curiae or electoral groups. The first curia included the large landowners, the highest taxpayers, and people who had reached a certain standard of education without regard to the amount they paid in taxes. To the second curia belonged inhabitants of the towns not qualified to vote in the first; to the third, country dwellers disqualified in the same way. With this curial system was combined the grouping of the mandates and of the electors according to the three dominant creeds (Catholic, Serbian Orthodox, Muslim). To the adherents of other creeds the right was conceded of voting with one or other of the religious electoral bodies within the curia to which they belonged.&lt;ref name=b1911/&gt;

On 28 June 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] visited the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital, [[Sarajevo]]. A group of six assassins ([[Cvjetko Popović]], [[Gavrilo Princip]], [[Muhamed Mehmedbašić]], [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]], [[Trifko Grabež]], [[Vaso Čubrilović]]) from the nationalist group [[Young Bosnia|Mlada Bosna]], supplied by the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], had gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade would pass. Čabrinović threw a [[Hand grenade|grenade]] at the car, but missed. It injured some people nearby, and Franz Ferdinand's convoy could carry on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them quickly. About an hour later, when Franz Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where [[Gavrilo Princip]] by coincidence stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie. The reaction among the Austrian people was mild, almost indifferent. As historian Z. A. B. Zeman later wrote, &quot;the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday [June 28 and 29], the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

====Decision for war====
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}
While the empire's military spending had not even doubled since the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], Germany's spending had risen fivefold, and the British, Russian, and French expenditures threefold. The empire had lost ethnic Italian areas to [[Piedmont]] because of nationalist movements that had swept through Italy, and many Austro-Hungarians perceived as imminent the threat of losing to [[Serbia]] the southern territories inhabited by Slavs. Serbia had recently gained considerable territory in the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913, causing much distress in government circles in Vienna and Budapest. Former ambassador and foreign minister Count [[Alois Aehrenthal]] had assumed that any future war would be in the Balkan region.

Hungarian prime minister and political scientist [[István Tisza]] opposed the expansion of the monarchy in the Balkans (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908) because &quot;the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs&quot;, which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 – PAGE:456&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Franz Joseph with a strongly apocalyptic, predictive and embittered tone. He used the hitherto unknown word &quot;Weltkrieg&quot; (meaning World War). &quot;It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War, p. 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) {{ISBN|9780691015958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MÁV armoured train.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[MÁVAG]] armoured train in 1914]]

On the day of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Tisza immediately traveled to Vienna where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Count Leopold Berchtold]] and Army Commander [[Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]]. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking Serbia. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to Emperor Franz Joseph saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fritz: Germany's Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|9780393097986}}, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza foresaw a possible Austrian military attack against the Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm|title=First World War.com – Who's Who – Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno|publisher=firstworldwar.com|access-date=28 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421135654/http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm|archive-date=21 April 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the government, such as Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, had wanted to confront the resurgent Serbian nation for some years in a preventive war, but the Emperor, 84 years old and an enemy of all adventures, disapproved.

The foreign ministry of Austro-Hungarian Empire sent ambassador [[László Szőgyény-Marich, Jr.|László Szőgyény]] to [[Potsdam]], where he inquired about the standpoint of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] on 5 July.
Szőgyény described what happened in a secret report to Vienna later that day:

{{Quotation|I presented His Majesty [Wilhelm] with [Franz Joseph's] letter and the attached memorandum. The Kaiser read both papers quite carefully in my presence. First, His Majesty assured me that he had expected us to take firm action against Serbia, but he had to concede that, as a result of the conflicts facing [Franz Joseph], he needed to take into account a serious complication in Europe, which is why he did not wish to give any definite answer prior to consultations with the chancellor....

When, after our déjeuner, I once again emphasized the gravity of the situation, His Majesty authorized me to report to [Franz Joseph] that in this case, too, we could count on Germany's full support. As mentioned, he first had to consult with the Chancellor, but he did not have the slightest doubt that [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg|Herr von Bethmann Hollweg]] would fully agree with him, particularly with regard to action on our part against Serbia. In his [Wilhelm's] opinion, though, there was no need to wait patiently before taking action.
The Kaiser said that Russia's stance would always be a hostile one, but he had been prepared for this for many years, and even if war broke out between Austria-Hungary and Russia, we could rest assured that Germany would take our side, in line with its customary loyalty. According to the Kaiser, as things stood now, Russia was not at all ready for war. It would certainly have to think hard before making a call to arms.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Ladislaus Count von Szögyény-Marich (Berlin) to Leopold Count von Berchtold (July 5, 1914), in Ludwig Bittner, et. al., eds., Österreich-Ungarns Aussenpolitik von der Bosnischen Krise 1908 bis zum Kriegsausbruch 1914 [Austria-Hungary's Foreign Policy prior to the Bosnian Crisis of 1908 up to the Outbreak of War in 1914]. 8 vols, Vienna, 1930, vol. 8, no. 10,058.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But now the leaders of Austria-Hungary, especially General Count Leopold von Berchtold, backed by its ally Germany, decided to confront Serbia militarily before it could incite a revolt; using the assassination as an excuse, they presented a list of ten demands called the [[July Ultimatum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;firstworldwar&quot;/&gt; expecting Serbia would never accept. When Serbia accepted nine of the ten demands but only partially accepted the remaining one, Austria-Hungary declared war. Franz Joseph I finally followed the urgent counsel of his top advisers.

Over the course of July and August 1914, these events caused the start of [[World War I]], as Russia mobilized in support of Serbia, setting off a series of counter-mobilizations. In support of his German ally, on Thursday, 6 August 1914, the Emperor Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war on Russia. Italy initially remained neutral, although it had an alliance with Austria-Hungary. In 1915, it switched to the side of the [[Triple Entente|Entente powers]], hoping to gain territory from its former ally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Clark (historian)|Christopher Clark]], ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' pp. 420–30 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime foreign policy===
{{Further|Diplomatic history of World War I}}
[[File:Die verbündeten Monarchen mit ihren Feldherren im 1. Weltkrieg.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Josef I]] and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] with military commanders during World War I]]
The Austro-Hungarian Empire played a relatively passive diplomatic role in the war, as it was increasingly dominated and controlled by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;A. F. Pribram, ''Austrian Foreign Policy, 1908–18'' (1923) pp 68–128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z.A.B. Zeman, ''A diplomatic history of the First World War'' (1971) pp 121–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  The only goal was to punish Serbia and try to stop the ethnic breakup of the Empire, and it completely failed.  Instead as the war went on the ethnic unity declined; the Allies encouraged breakaway demands from minorities and the Empire faced disintegration.  Starting in late 1916 the new Emperor Karl removed the pro-German officials and opened peace overtures to the Allies, whereby the entire war could be ended by compromise, or perhaps Austria would make a separate peace from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''The First World War and International Politics'' (1988) pp 139–48.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main effort was vetoed by Italy, which had been promised large slices of Austria for joining the Allies in 1915. Austria was only willing to turn over the Trentino region but nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;David Stevenson, &quot;The failure of peace by negotiation in 1917.&quot; ''Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 65–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl was seen as a defeatist, which weakened his standing at home and with both the Allies and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Keleher, &quot;Emperor Karl and the Sixtus Affair: Politico-Nationalist Repercussions in the Reich German and Austro-German Camps, and the Disintegration of Habsburg Austria, 1916–1918.&quot; ''East European Quarterly'' 26.2 (1992): 163+.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Imperial economy collapsed into severe hardship and even starvation, its multi-ethnic army lost its morale and was increasingly hard pressed to hold its line.  In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and opposition parties strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. As it became apparent that the Allies would win the war, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for their majority areas, started demanding full independence. The Emperor had lost much of his power to rule, as his realm disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Watson, ''Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary at War, 1914–1918'' (2014). pp 536–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the home front, food grew scarcer and scarcer, as did heating fuel. The hog population fell 90 percent, as the dwindling supplies of ham and bacon percent of the Army. Hungary, with its heavy agricultural base, was somewhat better fed. The Army conquered productive agricultural areas in Romania and elsewhere, but refused to allow food shipments to civilians back home.  Morale fell every year, and the diverse nationalities gave up on the Empire and looked for ways to establish their own nation states.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Healy, ''Vienna and the Fall of the Habsburg Empire: Total War and Everyday Life in World War I'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Inflation soared, from an index of 129 in 1914 to 1589 in 1918, wiping out the cash savings of the middle-class. In terms of war damage to the economy, the war used up about 20 percent of the GDP. The dead soldiers amounted to about four percent of the 1914 labor force, and the wounded ones to another six percent. Compared all the major countries in the war, the death and casualty rate was toward the high-end regarding the present-day territory of Austra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schulze2005&quot;/&gt;

By summer 1918, &quot;Green Cadres&quot; of army deserters formed armed bands in the hills of Croatia-Slavonia and civil authority disintegrated.  By late October violence and massive looting erupted and there were efforts to form peasant republics. However The Croatian political leadership was focused on creating a new state (Yugoslavia) and worked with the advancing Serbian army to impose control and end the uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Banac, &quot;'Emperor Karl Has Become a Comitadji': The Croatian Disturbances of Autumn 1918.&quot; ''Slavonic and East European Review'' 70#2 (1992): 284–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military events===
The Austro-Hungarian Empire conscripted 7.8 million soldiers during the WW1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHI3PCjDtsUC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Direct+and+Indirect+Costs+of+the+Great+World+War&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Direct%20and%20Indirect%20Costs%20of%20the%20Great%20World%20War|title=The European Powers in the First World War|author=Spencer Tucker|year=1996|page=173|isbn=9780815303992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
General von Hötzendorf was the Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff. Franz Joseph I, who was much too old to command the army, appointed [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Friedrich von Österreich-Teschen]] as Supreme Army Commander (Armeeoberkommandant), but asked him to give Von Hötzendorf freedom to take any decisions. Von Hötzendorf remained in effective command of the military forces until Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]] took the supreme command himself in late 1916 and dismissed Conrad von Hötzendorf in 1917. Meanwhile, economic conditions on the homefront deteriorated rapidly. The Empire depended on agriculture, and agriculture depended on the heavy labor of millions of men who were now in the Army. Food production fell, the transportation system became overcrowded, and industrial production could not successfully handle the overwhelming need for munitions. Germany provided a great deal of help, but it was not enough. Furthermore, the political instability of the multiple ethnic groups of Empire now ripped apart any hope for national consensus in support of the war. Increasingly there was a demand for breaking up the Empire and setting up autonomous national states based on historic language-based cultures. The new Emperor sought peace terms from the Allies, but his initiatives were vetoed by Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Watson, ''Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Serbian front 1914–1916====
{{main|Serbian Campaign (World War I)}}
At the start of the war, the army was divided in two: the smaller part attacked Serbia while the larger part fought against the formidable [[Imperial Russian Army]]. The invasion of Serbia in 1914 was a disaster: by the end of the year, the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] had taken no territory, but had lost 227,000 out of a total force of 450,000 men. However, in the autumn of 1915, the Serbian Army was defeated by the Central Powers, which led to the occupation of Serbia. Near the end of 1915, in a massive rescue operation involving more than 1,000 trips made by Italian, French and British steamers, 260,000 Serb surviving soldiers were transported to [[Corfu]], where they waited for the chance of the victory of Allied Powers to reclaim their country. Corfu hosted the Serbian government in exile after the collapse of Serbia, and served as a supply base to the Greek front. In April 1916 a large number of Serbian troops were transported in British and French naval vessels from Corfu to mainland Greece. The contingent numbering over 120,000 relieved a much smaller army at the [[Macedonian front]] and fought alongside British and French troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;history1&quot;/&gt;

====Russian front 1914–1917====
{{main|Eastern Front (World War I)}}
[[File:Szturm Twierdzy Przemysl A. Ritter von Meissl.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Siege of Przemyśl]] in 1915]]
On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]], the war started out equally poorly. The Austro-Hungarian Army was defeated at the [[Battle of Galicia|Battle of Lemberg]] and the great fortress city of [[Siege of Przemyśl|Przemyśl was besieged]] and fell in March 1915. The [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]] started as a minor German offensive to relieve the pressure of the Russian numerical superiority on the Austro-Hungarians, but the cooperation of the Central Powers resulted in huge Russian losses and the total collapse of the Russian lines, and their {{convert|100|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long retreat into Russia. The Russian Third Army perished. In summer 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Army, under a unified command with the Germans, participated in the successful [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]]. From June 1916, the Russians focused their attacks on the Austro-Hungarian army in the [[Brusilov Offensive]], recognizing the numerical inferiority of the Austro-Hungarian army. By the end of September 1916, Austria-Hungary mobilized and concentrated new divisions, and the successful Russian advance was halted and slowly repelled; but the Austrian armies took heavy losses (about 1 million men) and never recovered. The [[Battle of Zborov (1917)]] was the first significant action of the [[Czechoslovak Legions]], who fought for the independence of Czechoslovakia against the Austro-Hungarian army. However the huge losses in men and material inflicted on the Russians during the offensive contributed greatly to the [[Russian Revolution|revolutions of 1917]], and it caused an economic crash in the [[Russian Empire]].

====Italian front 1915–1918====

[[File:Sacrario Militare di Redipuglia.jpg|thumb|The [[Redipuglia War Memorial]] (Italy), the resting place of approximately 100,000 Italian soldiers dead in battles of the First World War]]

In May 1915, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] attacked Austria-Hungary. Italy was the only military opponent of Austria-Hungary which had a similar degree of industrialization and economic level; moreover, her army was numerous (≈1,000,000 men were immediately fielded), but suffered from poor leadership, training and organization. [[Chief of Staff]] [[Luigi Cadorna]] marched his army towards the [[Isonzo]] river, hoping to seize [[Ljubljana]], and to eventually threaten Vienna. However, the [[Royal Italian Army]] were halted on the river, where [[Battles of the Isonzo|four battles]] took place over five months (23 June – 2 December 1915). The fight was extremely bloody and exhausting for both the contenders.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Schindler, ''Isonzo: The Forgotten Sacrifice of the Great War'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 1916, the Austrian Chief of Staff Conrad von Hötzendorf launched the ''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]'' (&quot;[[punitive expedition]]&quot;): the Austrians broke through the opposing front and occupied the [[Asiago plateau]]. The Italians managed to resist and in a counteroffensive seized [[Gorizia]] on 9 August. Nonetheless, they had to stop on the [[Carso]], a few kilometres away from the border. At this point, several months of indecisive [[trench warfare]] ensued (analogous to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western front]]). As the Russian Empire collapsed as a result of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Russians ended their involvement in the war]], Germans and Austrians were able to move on the Western and Southern fronts much manpower from the erstwhile Eastern fighting.

On 24 October 1917, Austrians (now enjoying decisive German support) attacked at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]] using new infiltration tactics; although they advanced more than {{convert|100|km|2|sp=us|abbr=on}} in the direction of [[Venice]] and gained considerable supplies, they were halted and could not cross the [[Piave (river)|Piave]] river. Italy, although suffering massive casualties, recovered from the blow, and a [[coalition government]] under [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] was formed. Italy also enjoyed support by the Entente powers: by 1918, large amounts of war materials and a few auxiliary American, British, and French divisions arrived in the Italian battle zone.&lt;ref&gt;Gaetano V. Cavallaro (2010). The Beginning of Futility: Diplomatic, Political, Military and Naval Events on the Austro-Italian Front in the First World War 1914–1917 I. p.&amp;nbsp;339. {{ISBN|9781401084264}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cadorna was replaced by General [[Armando Diaz]]; under his command, the Italians retook the initiative and won the decisive [[Battle of the Piave river]] (15–23 June 1918), in which some 60,000 Austrian and 43,000 Italian soldiers were killed. The multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire started to disintegrate, leaving its army alone on the battlefields. The final battle was at [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]; after 4 days of stiff resistance, Italian troops crossed the Piave River, and after losing 90,000 men the defeated Austrian troops retreated in disarray pursued by the Italians. The Italians captured 448,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers about one-third of the imperial-royal army, 24 of whom were generals,&lt;ref&gt;Pier Paolo Cervone, ''Vittorio Veneto, l'ultima battaglia'', Milano, Mursia, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 5,600 cannons and mortars, and 4,000 [[Heavy machine guns|machine guns]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Indro Montanelli]]; Mario Cervi, ''Due secoli di guerre'', VII, Novara, Editoriale Nuova, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The military breakdown also marked the start of the rebellion for the numerous ethnicities who made up the multiethnic Empire, as they refused to keep on fighting for a cause which now appeared senseless. These events marked the end of Austria-Hungary, which collapsed on 31 October 1918. The armistice was signed at [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|Villa Giusti]] on 3 November.

====Romanian front 1916–1917====
{{main|Romania during World War I}}
On 27 August 1916, [[Romania]] declared war against Austria-Hungary. The [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Army]] crossed the borders of Eastern Hungary ([[Transylvania]]), and despite initial successes, by November 1916, the Central Powers formed by the Austro-Hungarian, German, Bulgarian, and Ottoman armies, had defeated the Romanian and Russian armies of the Entente Powers, and occupied the southern part of Romania (including [[Oltenia]], [[Muntenia]] and [[Dobruja]]). Within 3 months of war, the Central Powers came near Bucharest, the Romanian capital city. On 6 December, the Central Powers captured [[Bucharest]], and part of the population moved to the unoccupied Romanian territory, in [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]], together with the Romanian government, royal court and public authorities, which relocated to [[Iași]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn E. Torrey, ''Romania and World War I'' (Histria Books, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, after several defensive victories (managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance), with Russia's withdrawal from the war following the October Revolution, Romania was forced to drop out of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=2990 Gary W. Shanafelt. Review of Torrey, Glenn E., Romania and World War I: A Collection of Studies. HABSBURG, H-Net Reviews. April, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the German army realized it needed close cooperation from the homefront, Habsburg officers saw themselves as entirely separate from the civilian world, and superior to it. When they occupied productive areas, such as southern Romania,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/7632/1/JPN-Serbian-2014.pdf|title=Serbian and Habsburg Military institutional legacies in Yugoslavia after 1918|last=Newman|first=John|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225162034/http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/7632/1/JPN-Serbian-2014.pdf|archive-date=25 February 2019|url-status=live|access-date=24 February 2019|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; they seized food stocks and other supplies for their own purposes, and blocked any shipments intended for civilians back in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The result was that the officers lived well, as the civilians began to starve. Vienna even transferred training units to Serbia and Poland for the sole purpose of feeding them. In all, the Army obtained about 15 percent of its cereal needs from occupied territories.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Ring of Steel'' p 396-97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of Hungary===
[[File:Csíkpálfalva2.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|right|War memorial in [[Păuleni-Ciuc]], Romania]]

Although the Kingdom of Hungary composed only 42% of the population of Austria-Hungary,&lt;ref&gt;See: 1910 census&lt;/ref&gt; the thin majority – more than 3.8 million soldiers – of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces were conscripted from the Kingdom of Hungary during the First World War. Roughly 600,000 soldiers were killed in action, and 700,000 soldiers were wounded in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buranbaeva|first1=Oksana|last2=Mladineo|first2=Vanja|title=Culture and Customs of Hungary, Cultures and Customs of the World|page=32|year=2011|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|location=Bonn, Germany|isbn=9780313383700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WK_130Hqbr4C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22austria-hungary%22+%22kingdom+of+Hungary%22+million+soldiers#v=onepage&amp;q=%22austria-hungary%22%20%22kingdom%20of%20Hungary%22%20million%20soldiers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria-Hungary held on for years, as the Hungarian half provided sufficient supplies for the military to continue to wage war.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; This was shown in a transition of power after which the Hungarian prime minister, Count [[István Tisza]], and foreign minister, Count [[István Burián]], had decisive influence over the internal and external affairs of the monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; By late 1916, food supply from Hungary became intermittent and the government sought an armistice with the Entente powers. However, this failed as Britain and France no longer had any regard for the integrity of the monarchy because of Austro-Hungarian support for Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;

===Analysis of defeat===
The setbacks that the Austrian army suffered in 1914 and 1915 can be attributed to a large extent to Austria-Hungary becoming a military satellite of [[Imperial Germany]] from the first day of the war. They were made worse by the incompetence of the Austrian high command.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; After attacking Serbia, its forces soon had to be withdrawn to protect its eastern frontier against Russia's invasion, while German units were engaged in fighting on [[Western Front (World War I)|the Western Front]]. This resulted in a greater than expected loss of men in the invasion of Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, it became evident that the Austrian high command had had no plans for a possible continental war and that the army and navy were also ill-equipped to handle such a conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;

From 1916, the Austro-Hungarian war effort became more and more subordinated to the direction of German planners. The Austrians viewed the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]] favorably, on the other hand by 1916 the general belief in Germany was that Germany, in its alliance with Austria-Hungary, was &quot;shackled to a corpse&quot;. The operational capability of the Austro-Hungarian army was seriously affected by supply shortages, low morale and a high casualty rate, and by the army's composition of multiple ethnicities with different languages and customs.

The last two successes for the Austrians, the Romanian Offensive and the Caporetto Offensive, were German-assisted operations. As the Dual Monarchy became more politically unstable, it became more and more dependent on German assistance. The majority of its people, other than Hungarians and German Austrians, became increasingly restless.

In 1917, the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]] of the Entente Powers completely collapsed.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated. Leftist and pacifist political movements organized strikes in factories, and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. During the Italian battles, the Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs declared their independence. On 31 October Hungary ended the personal union with Austria, officially dissolving the Monarchy. At the last Italian offensive, the Austro-Hungarian Army took to the field without any food and munition supply, and fought without any political supports for a ''de facto'' non-existent empire. On the end of the decisive joint Italian, British and French offensive at Vittorio Veneto, the disintegrated Austria-Hungary signed the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] on 3 November 1918.

The government had failed badly on the homefront. Historian Alexander Watson reports:
{{quote|across central Europe&amp;nbsp;... The majority lived in a state of advanced misery by the spring of 1918, and conditions later worsened, for the summer of 1918 saw both the drop in food supplied to the levels of the '[[turnip winter]]', and the onset of the [[1918 flu pandemic]] that killed at least 20 million worldwide. Society was relieved, exhausted and yearned for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Watson, ''Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I'' (2014), p 536&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Dissolution==
The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed with dramatic speed in the autumn of 1918. In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and politicians (the opposition parties) strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. These leftist or left-liberal pro-Entente maverick parties opposed the monarchy as a form of government and considered themselves internationalist rather than patriotic. Eventually, the German defeat and the minor revolutions in Vienna and Budapest gave political power to the left/liberal political parties. As it became apparent that the Allied powers would win World War I, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for various areas, started pressing for full independence. The Emperor had lost much of his power to rule, as his realm disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Ring of Steel'' pp 536–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Watson argues that, &quot;The Habsburg regime's doom was sealed when Wilson's response to the note, sent two and a half weeks earlier, arrived on 20 October.&quot; Wilson rejected the continuation of the dual monarchy as a negotiable possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Ring of Steel'' pp 541–2&lt;/ref&gt; As one of his [[Fourteen Points]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the nationalities of Austria-Hungary have the &quot;freest opportunity to autonomous development&quot;. In response, Emperor Karl I agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament in 1917 and allow the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the leaders of these national groups rejected the idea; they deeply distrusted Vienna and were now determined to get independence.

[[File:Poprava vůdců rumburské vzpoury 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The revolt of ethnic [[Czechs|Czech]] units in Austria in May 1918 was brutally suppressed. It was considered a [[mutiny]] by the code of [[military justice]].]]
On 14 October 1918, Foreign Minister [[István Burián|Baron István Burián von Rajecz]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa&quot;/&gt; asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points. In an apparent attempt to demonstrate good faith, Emperor Karl issued a proclamation (&quot;Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918&quot;) two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy. The Polish majority regions of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Lodomeria]] were to be granted the option of seceding from the empire, and it was understood that they would join their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in resurrecting a Polish state. The rest of [[Cisleithania]] was transformed into a federal union composed of four parts—German, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian. Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the empire with Vienna. [[Trieste]] was to receive a special status. No such proclamation could be issued in Hungary, where Hungarian aristocrats still believed they could subdue other nationalities and maintain the &quot;Holy Kingdom of St. Stephen&quot;.

It was a dead letter. Four days later, on 18 October, United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, Lansing said, autonomy for the nationalities – the tenth of the Fourteen Points – was no longer enough and Washington could not deal on the basis of the Fourteen Points anymore. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies on 14 October. The South Slavs in both halves of the monarchy had already declared in favor of uniting with Serbia in a large South Slav state by way of the 1917 [[Corfu Declaration]] signed by members of the [[Yugoslav Committee]]. Indeed, the Croatians had begun disregarding orders from Budapest earlier in October.

The Lansing note was, in effect, the death certificate of Austria-Hungary. The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries. With defeat in the war imminent after the Italian offensive in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto on 24 October, Czech politicians peacefully took over command in Prague on 28 October (later declared the birthday of Czechoslovakia) and followed up in other major cities in the next few days. On 30 October, the Slovaks followed in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]]. On 29 October, the Slavs in both portions of what remained of Austria-Hungary proclaimed the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. They also declared that their ultimate intention was to unite with Serbia and Montenegro in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|a large South Slav state]]. On the same day, the Czechs and Slovaks formally proclaimed the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent state.

In Hungary, the most prominent opponent of continued union with Austria, Count [[Mihály Károlyi]], seized power in the [[Aster Revolution]] on 31 October. Charles was all but forced to appoint Károlyi as his Hungarian prime minister. One of Károlyi's first acts was to cancel the compromise agreement, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state.

By the end of October, there was nothing left of the Habsburg realm but its majority-German Danubian and Alpine provinces, and Karl's authority was being challenged even there by the German-Austrian state council.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Ring of Steel'' pp 542–56&lt;/ref&gt; Karl's last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], concluded that Karl was in an impossible situation, and persuaded Karl that the best course was to relinquish, at least temporarily, his right to exercise sovereign authority.

===Consequences===
On 11 November, Karl issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/emperor-karl-abdication-proclamation The 1918 Karl's proclamation]. British Library.&lt;/ref&gt; He also renounced the right to participate in Austrian affairs of state. He also dismissed Lammasch and his government from office and released the officials in the Austrian half of the empire from their oath of loyalty to him. Two days later, he issued a similar proclamation for Hungary. However, he did not abdicate, remaining available in the event the people of either state should recall him. For all intents and purposes, this was the end of Habsburg rule.

Still filled with unchangeable love for all My peoples, I do not want to oppose the free development of My Person as an obstacle.

I recognize in advance the decision that German Austria will make regarding its future form of government.

[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|The [[Treaty of Trianon]]: Kingdom of Hungary lost 72% of its land and 3.3 million people of Hungarian ethnicity.]]
Karl's refusal to abdicate was ultimately irrelevant. On the day after he announced his withdrawal from Austria's politics, the German-Austrian National Council proclaimed the [[Republic of German Austria]].  Károlyi followed suit on 16 November, proclaiming the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]].

The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] (between the victors of World War I and Austria) and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (between the victors and Hungary) regulated the new borders of Austria and Hungary, leaving both as small landlocked states. The Allies assumed without question that the minority nationalities wanted to leave Austria and Hungary, and also allowed them to annex significant blocks of German- and Hungarian-speaking territory. As a result, the [[First Austrian Republic|Republic of Austria]] lost roughly 60% of the old [[Austrian Empire]]'s territory. It also had to drop its plans for union with Germany, as it was not allowed to unite with Germany without League approval. The [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|restored Kingdom of Hungary]], which had replaced the republican government in 1920, lost roughly 72% of the pre-war territory of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

The decisions of the nations of the former Austria-Hungary and of the victors of the Great War, contained in the heavily one-sided treaties, had devastating political and economic effects. The previously rapid economic growth of the Dual Monarchy ground to a halt because the new borders became major economic barriers. All the formerly well-established industries, as well as the infrastructure supporting them, were designed to satisfy the needs of an extensive realm. As a result, the emerging countries were forced to make considerable sacrifices to transform their economies. The treaties created major political unease. As a result of these economic difficulties, extremist movements gained strength; and there was no regional superpower in central Europe.

The new Austrian state was, at least on paper, on shakier ground than Hungary. Unlike its former Hungarian partner, Austria had never been a nation in any real sense. While the Austrian state had existed in one form or another for 700 years, it was united only by loyalty to the Habsburgs. With the loss of 60% of the Austrian Empire's prewar territory, [[Vienna]] was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. However, after a brief period of upheaval and the Allies' foreclosure of union with Germany, Austria established itself as a federal republic. Despite the temporary ''[[Anschluss]]'' with [[Nazi Germany]], it still survives today. [[Adolf Hitler]] cited that all &quot;Germans&quot; – such as him and the others from Austria, etc. – should be united with Germany.

By comparison, Hungary had been a nation and a state for over 900 years. Hungary, however, was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The Hungarian Democratic Republic was short-lived and was temporarily replaced by the communist [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. Romanian troops ousted [[Béla Kun]] and his communist government during the [[Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919]].

In the summer of 1919, a Habsburg, [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria|Archduke Joseph August]], became regent, but was forced to stand down after only two weeks when it became apparent the Allies would not recognise him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die amtliche Meldung über den Rücktritt|publisher=[[Neue Freie Presse]], Morgenblatt|date=24 August 1919|page=2|language=German|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&amp;aid=nfp&amp;datum=19190824&amp;seite=2&amp;zoom=2|access-date=2 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226211328/http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&amp;aid=nfp&amp;datum=19190824&amp;seite=2&amp;zoom=2|archive-date=26 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in March 1920, royal powers were entrusted to a [[regent]], [[Miklós Horthy]], who had been the last commanding [[admiral]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] and had helped organize the counter-revolutionary forces. It was this government that signed the Treaty of Trianon under protest on 4 June 1920 at the [[Grand Trianon|Grand Trianon Palace]] in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Trianon, Treaty of|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-TrianonTr.html|encyclopedia=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]|year=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228011000/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-TrianonTr.html|archive-date=28 December 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia of ww1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer|author2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|title=Encyclopedia of World War I|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C|edition=1|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094202|page=1183|quote=Virtually the entire population of what remained of Hungary regarded the Treaty of Trianon as manifestly unfair, and agitation for revision began immediately.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and again in October 1921, ill-prepared attempts by Karl to [[Charles I of Austria's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary|regain the throne in Budapest]] collapsed. The initially wavering Horthy, after receiving threats of intervention from the Allied Powers and neighboring countries, refused his cooperation. Soon afterward, the Hungarian government nullified the Pragmatic Sanction, effectively dethroning the Habsburgs. Two years later, Austria had passed the &quot;[[Habsburg Law]],&quot; which not only dethroned the Habsburgs, but banned Karl from ever returning to Austria again.

Subsequently, the British took custody of Karl and removed him and his family to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he died the following year.

====Successor states====
{{Main|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Saint Germain}}

The following [[successor state]]s were formed (entirely or in part) on the territory of the former Austria-Hungary:
* [[German Austria]] and the [[First Austrian Republic]]
* [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], [[Hungarian Republic (1919–20)|Hungarian Republic]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]]
* [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] (&quot;Czechoslovakia&quot; from 1920 to 1938)
* [[Second Polish Republic]]
* [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (joined on 1 December 1918 with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]])
* [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (united with the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] through [[Act Zluky]], while its territory was fully overran by the [[Second Polish Republic]])
* Duchy of [[Bukovina]], [[Transylvania]] and two-thirds of the [[Banat]] were joined to the [[Kingdom of Romania]]

Austro-Hungarian lands were also ceded to the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. The [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]], which had formerly looked to Vienna for protection, formed a customs and defense union with [[Switzerland]], and adopted the Swiss currency instead of the Austrian. In April 1919, [[Vorarlberg]] – the westernmost province of Austria – voted by a large majority to join Switzerland; however, both the Swiss and the Allies disregarded this result.

The following present-day countries and parts of countries were within the boundaries of Austria-Hungary when the empire was dissolved:

'''[[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]''' ('''[[Cisleithania]]'''):
* Austria (except [[Burgenland]])
* [[Czech Republic]] (except the [[Hlučín Region|Hlučínsko]] area)
* [[Slovenia]] (except [[Prekmurje]])
* Italy ([[Trentino]], [[South Tyrol]], parts of the [[province of Belluno]] and small portions of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]])
* [[Croatia]] (Dalmatia, Istria)
* [[Poland]] (voivodeships of [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser Poland]], [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Subcarpathia]], southernmost part of [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesia]] (Bielsko and Cieszyn))
* [[Ukraine]] (oblasts of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] (except its northern corner) and most of the oblast of [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]])
* [[Romania]] (county of [[Suceava County|Suceava]])
* [[Montenegro]] (bay of [[Bay of Kotor|Boka Kotorska]], the coast and the immediate hinterland around the cities of [[Budva]], [[Petrovac (Montenegro)|Petrovac]] and [[Sutomore]])

'''[[Kingdom of Hungary]]''' ('''[[Transleithania]]'''):
* [[Hungary]];
* [[Slovakia]]
* Austria ([[Burgenland]])
* [[Slovenia]] ([[Prekmurje]])
* [[Croatia]] (Croatian [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] and [[Međimurje County|Međimurje county]], [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Fiume]] as ''corpus separatum'' along with [[Slavonia]] and [[Central Croatia]] were not part of Hungary proper, the latter two were part of the sovereign Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia)
* [[Ukraine]] (oblast of [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]])
* [[Romania]] (region of [[Transylvania]], [[Partium]] and parts of [[Banat]], [[Crișana]], and [[Maramureș]])
* [[Serbia]] (autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]] and northern [[Belgrade]] region)
* [[Poland]] (Polish parts of [[Orava (region)|Orava]] and [[Spiš]])
* 

'''[[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austro-Hungarian Condominium]]'''
* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (the villages of [[Zavalje]], [[Mali Skočaj]] and [[Veliki Skočaj]] including the immediate surrounding area west of the city of [[Bihać]])
* [[Montenegro]] ([[Sutorina]] – western part of the Municipality of [[Herceg Novi]] between present borders with Croatia (SW) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (NW), [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]] (E) and the township of Igalo (NE))
* [[Sandžak|Sandžak-Raška region]], Austro-Hungarian occupied 1878 until withdrawal in 1908 whilst formally part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]

''Possessions of the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]''
* The empire was unable to gain and maintain large colonies owing to its geographical position. Its only possession outside of Europe was its [[Concessions in Tianjin#Austro-Hungarian concession (1901–1917)|concession in Tianjin]], [[China]], which it was granted in return for supporting the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] in suppressing the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. However although the city was only an Austro-Hungarian possession for 16 years, the Austro-Hungarians left their mark on that area of the city, in the form of architecture that still stands in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;information&quot;/&gt;
Other parts of Europe had been part of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] monarchy once but had left it before its dissolution in 1918. Prominent examples are the regions of [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]] in Italy, [[Silesia]] in Poland, most of [[Belgium]] and [[Serbia]], and parts of northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany.
They persuaded the government to search out [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] to build up infrastructure such as railroads. Despite these measures, Austria-Hungary remained resolutely monarchist and authoritarian.

==Flags and heraldry==

===Flags===
{{See also|List of Austrian flags|List of Hungarian flags}}
Austria-Hungary did not have a common flag (a &quot;[[national flag]]&quot; could not exist since the Dual Monarchy consisted of two sovereign states). However, the [[Flag of the Habsburg Monarchy|flag]] of the ruling [[Habsburg Dynasty]] was sometimes used as a ''de facto'' national flag and a common [[civil ensign]] was introduced in 1869 for civilian vessels. Until 1918, the k.u.k. War Fleet continued to carry the Austrian ensign it had used since 1786; and the regiments of the k.u.k. Army carried the double-eagle banners they had used before 1867, as they had a long history in many cases. New ensigns created in 1915 were not implemented due to the ongoing war. At state functions, the Austrian black-yellow and the Hungarian red-white-green tricolor were used.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Austria was represented by the black-yellow flag. The Hungarian half of the state, on the other hand, legally had no flag of its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/~habsweb/sourcetexts/nagodba2.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210030751/http://www.h-net.org/~habsweb/sourcetexts/nagodba2.htm|url-status=dead|title=Habsburg &amp;#124; H-Net|archive-date=10 February 2012|website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]] (art. 62 and 63), in all joint Croatian and Hungarian affairs, symbols of both Croatia and Hungary respectively had to be used. For instance, whenever the joint Hungarian-Croatian Parliament held its session in Budapest, both the [[Croatian flag|Croatian]] and [[Hungarian flag|Hungarian]] flags were hoisted on the parliament building in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austria.

===Coat of arms===
{{See also|Coat of arms of Austria-Hungary}}
The [[double-headed eagle]] of the House of Habsburg was used as the [[Coat of arms of Austria-Hungary|coat of arms]] of the common institutions of Austria-Hungary between 1867 and 1915. In 1915, a new one was introduced, which combined the coat of arms of the two halves of the Dual Monarchy and that of the dynasty.

==History==
[[File:Abracadabra triangle (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Abracadabra written in a triangular form as represented in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'']] 
The first known mention of the word was in the second century AD in a book called ''Liber Medicinalis'' (sometimes known as ''De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima'') by [[Serenus Sammonicus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Vollmer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Sammonicus|first=Quintus Serenus |authorlink=Serenus Sammonicus|title=Quinti Sereni Samonici De medicina praecepta salvberrima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5FOAAAAYAAJ|year=1786|publisher=In bibliopolio I.G. Mülleriano|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physician]] to the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caracalla]], who in chapter 51 prescribed that [[malaria]] sufferers wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shah |first1=Sonia |title=The Tenacious Buzz of Malaria |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704111704575354911834340450 |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html Bartleby] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122135703/http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of the amulet, he claimed, makes lethal diseases go away. Other Roman emperors, including [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]] and [[Severus Alexander]], were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vollmer&quot; /&gt;

It was used as a [[magical formula]] by the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] of the [[Basilideans|sect of Basilides]] in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abracadabra}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found on [[Abraxas]] stones, which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.

The Puritan minister [[Increase Mather]] dismissed the word as bereft of power. [[Daniel Defoe]] also wrote dismissively about Londoners who posted the word on their doorways to ward off sickness during the [[Great Plague of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe. [https://archive.org/stream/journalofplagu00defo#page/38/mode/2up ''A Journal of the Plague Year'']. London, Dent, 1911 (1722)&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is now commonly used as an [[incantation]] in the performance of magic.

{{United Kingdom constitutional formation}}
The '''Acts of Union''' were two [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]: the '''Union with Scotland Act 1706''' passed by the [[Parliament of England]], and the '''Union with England Act''' passed in 1707 by the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. They put into effect the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]{{mdash}}which at the time were separate [[sovereign state|states]] with separate legislatures, but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]{{mdash}}were, in the words of the Treaty, &quot;United into One Kingdom by the Name of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Article I of the Treaty of Union&lt;/ref&gt;

The two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his [[double first cousin]] twice removed, [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]). Prior to the Acts of Union there had been three previous attempts (in 1606, 1667, and 1689) to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.

The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London, the home of the English Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 3&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, the historian [[Simon Schama]] said &quot;What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 22 May 2001 |number=10 |minutes=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Background prior to 1707==
===1603-1660===
Prior to 1603, England and Scotland were separate kingdoms; as [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] never married, after  1567, her heir became the Stuart king of Scotland, [[James VI and I|James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant. After her death, the two Crowns were held in personal union by James, as James I of England, and James VI of Scotland. He announced his intention to unite the two, using the [[royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] to take the title &quot;King of Great Britain&quot;, {{sfn|Larkin, Hughes|1973|page=19}} and give a British character to his court and person.{{sfn|Lockyer|1998|pp=51–52}}
[[File:The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Scottish opposition to Stuart attempts to impose religious union led to the 1638 National Covenant]]
The 1603 [[Union of England and Scotland Act 1603|Union of England and Scotland Act]] established a joint Commission to agree terms, but the [[English Parliament]] was concerned this would lead to the imposition of an [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] structure similar to that of Scotland. James was forced to withdraw his proposals, and attempts to revive it in 1610 were met with hostility.{{sfn|Lockyer|1998|pp=54–59}}

Instead, he set about creating a unified Church of Scotland and England, as the first step towards a centralised, Unionist state.{{sfn|Stephen|2010|pp=55–58}} However, despite both being nominally [[Episcopal_polity|Episcopalian]] in structure, the two were very different in doctrine; the [[Church of Scotland]], or kirk, was [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] in doctrine, and viewed many [[Church of England]] practices as little better than Catholicism.{{sfn|McDonald|1998|pp=75–76}} As a result, attempts to impose religious policy by James and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ultimately led to the 1639-1651 [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].

The 1639–1640 [[Bishops' Wars]] confirmed the primacy of the kirk, and established a [[Covenanter]] government in Scotland. The Scots remained neutral when the [[First English Civil War]] began in 1642, before becoming concerned at the impact on Scotland of a Royalist victory.{{sfn|Kaplan|1970|pp=50–70}} Presbyterian leaders like [[Archibald_Campbell,_1st_Marquess_of_Argyll|Argyll]] viewed union as a way to ensure free trade between England and Scotland, and preserve a Presbyterian kirk.{{sfn|Robertson|2014|p=125}}
[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|right|The 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] between England and Scotland]]
Under the 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]], the Covenanters agreed to provide military support for the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]], in return for religious union. Although the treaty referred repeatedly to 'union' between England, Scotland, and Ireland, political union had little support outside the Kirk Party. Even religious union was opposed by the Episcopalian majority in the Church of England, and [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] like [[Oliver Cromwell]], who dominated the [[New Model Army]].

The Scots and English Presbyterians were political conservatives, who increasingly viewed the Independents, and associated radical groups like the [[Levellers]], as a bigger threat than the Royalists. Both Royalists and Presbyterians agreed monarchy was divinely ordered, but disagreed on the nature and extent of Royal authority over the church. When Charles I surrendered in 1646, they allied with their former enemies to restore him to the English throne.{{sfn|Harris|2015|pp=53–54}}

After defeat in the 1647–1648 [[Second English Civil War]], Scotland was occupied by English troops which were withdrawn once the so-called [[Engagers]] whom Cromwell held responsible for the war had been replaced by the Kirk Party. In December 1648, [[Pride's Purge]] confirmed Cromwell's political control in England by removing Presbyterian MPs from Parliament, and executing Charles in January 1649. Seeing this as sacrilege, the Kirk Party proclaimed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] King of Scotland and Great Britain, and agreed to restore him to the English throne.

Defeat in the 1649–1651 [[Third English Civil War|Third English Civil War or Anglo-Scottish War]] resulted in Scotland's incorporation into the [[Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]], largely driven by Cromwell's determination to break the power of the kirk, which he held responsible for the Anglo-Scottish War.{{sfn|Morrill|1990|p=162}} The 1652 [[Tender of Union]] was followed on 12 April 1654 by ''An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland,'' creating the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur098.htm Constitution.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It was ratified by the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]] on 26 June 1657, creating a single Parliament in Westminster, with 30 representatives each from Scotland and Ireland added to the existing English members.&lt;ref&gt;The 1657 Act's long title was ''An Act and Declaration touching several Acts and Ordinances made since 20 April 1653, and before 3 September 1654, and other Acts''&lt;/ref&gt;

===1660-1707===
[[File:Cromwell at Dunbar Andrew Carrick Gow.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Battle of Dunbar (1650)]]; Scotland was incorporated into the Commonwealth after defeat in the 1650-1651 Anglo-Scots War.]]
While integration into the Commonwealth established free trade between Scotland and England, the economic benefits were diminished by the costs of military occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html Parliament.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012160340/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html |date=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Scotland and England associated union with heavy taxes and military rule; it had little popular support in either country, and was dissolved after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of Charles II in 1660.

The Scottish economy was badly damaged by the English [[Navigation Acts]] of 1660 and 1663 and wars with the Dutch Republic, its major export market. An Anglo-Scots Trade Commission was set up in January 1668 but the English had no interest in making concessions, as the Scots had little to offer in return. In 1669, Charles II revived talks on political union; his motives were to weaken Scotland's commercial and political links with the Dutch, still seen as an enemy and complete the work of his grandfather James I.{{sfn|MacIntosh|2007|pp=79–87}} Continued opposition meant these negotiations were abandoned by the end of 1669.{{sfn|Whatley|2001|p=95}}

Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, a [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] met in Edinburgh in April 1689 to agree a new constitutional settlement; during which the Scottish Bishops backed a proposed union in an attempt to preserve Episcopalian control of the kirk. [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] were supportive of the idea but it was opposed both by the Presbyterian majority in Scotland and the English Parliament.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=305}} Episcopacy in Scotland was abolished in 1690, alienating a significant part of the political class; it was this element that later formed the bedrock of opposition to Union.{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=404–406}}

The 1690s were a time of economic hardship in Europe as a whole and Scotland in particular, a period now known as the [[Seven ill years]] which led to strained relations with England.{{sfn|Whatley|2006|p=91}} In 1698, the [[Company of Scotland|Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies]] received a charter to raise capital through public subscription.{{sfn|Mitchison|2002|pp=301–302}} The Company invested in the [[Darién scheme]], an ambitious plan funded almost entirely by Scottish investors to build a colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] for trade with East Asia.{{sfn|Richards|2004|p=79}} The scheme was a disaster; the losses of over £150,000 severely impacted the Scottish commercial system.{{sfn|Mitchison|2002|p=314}} 

==Political motivations==
[[File:QueenAnne1702.jpg|thumb|160px||right|Queen Anne in 1702]]
The Acts of Union should be seen within a wider European context of increasing state centralisation during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, including the monarchies of France, Sweden, Denmark and Spain. While there were exceptions, such as the [[Dutch Republic]] or the [[Republic of Venice]], the trend was clear.{{sfn|Munck|2005|pp=429–431}}

The dangers of the monarch using one Parliament against the other first became apparent in 1647 and 1651. It resurfaced during the 1679 to 1681 [[Exclusion Crisis]], caused by English resistance to the Catholic [[James II of England|James]] succeeding his brother Charles. James was sent to Edinburgh in 1681 as [[Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]]; in August, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act, confirming the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion,' the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It then went beyond ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by explicitly stating the aim was to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.'{{sfn|Jackson|2003|pp=38–54}}

The issue reappeared during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]]. The English Parliament generally supported replacing James with his Protestant daughter [[Mary II]], but resisted making her Dutch husband [[William III &amp; II]] joint ruler. They gave way only when he threatened to return to the Netherlands, and Mary refused to rule without him.{{sfn|Horwitz|1986|pp=10-11}}

In Scotland, conflict over control of the kirk between Presbyterians and Episcopalians and William's position as a fellow Calvinist put him in a much stronger position. He originally insisted on retaining Episcopacy, and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body that controlled what legislation Parliament could debate. Both would have given the Crown far greater control than in England but he withdrew his demands due to the 1689-1692 Jacobite Rising.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|pp=300–303}}

=== English perspective ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}
The English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne. The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England. The English succession was provided for by the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the [[House of Hanover]]. Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]: the Scottish [[Act of Security 1704]] granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation.

=== Scottish perspective ===
The Scottish economy was severely impacted by [[privateers]] during the 1688 to 1697 [[Nine Years War]], and the 1701 [[War of the Spanish Succession]], with the [[Royal Navy]] focusing on protecting English ships. This compounded the economic pressure caused by the [[Darien scheme]], and the [[Seven_ill_years|Seven ill years]] of the 1690s, when between 5-15% of the population died of starvation.{{sfn|Cullen|2010|p=117}} The Scottish Parliament was promised financial assistance, protection for its maritime trade, and an end of economic restrictions on trade with England.{{sfn|Whatley|2001|p=48}}

The votes of the Court party, combined with the majority of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]], were sufficient to ensure passage of the treaty. Article 15 granted [[Pound sterling|£]]398,085 10[[Shilling|s]] sterling to Scotland, a sum known as [[The Equivalent]], to offset future liability towards the English national debt. This was used to compensate investors in the Darien scheme, with 58.6% of the fund allocated to its shareholders and creditors.{{sfn|Watt|2007|p=?}}
[[File:Downsitting of the Scottish Parliament detail.JPG|thumb|left|18th-century French illustration of an opening of the Scottish Parliament]]
The role played by bribery has long been debated; £20,000 was distributed by the [[Earl of Glasgow]], of which 60% went to [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry]], the [[Queen's Commissioner in Parliament]]. [[Robert Burns]] is commonly quoted in support; &quot;We're bought and sold for English Gold, Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.&quot; As historian [[Christopher Whatley]] points out, this was actually a 17th century Scots folk song; he agrees money was paid, but suggests the economic benefits were supported by most Scots MPs, however reluctantly.{{sfn|Whatley |1989|pp=160-165}}   

[[George Lockhart (politician)|Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath]], the only Scottish negotiator to oppose Union, noted &quot;the whole nation appears against (it)&quot;. Another negotiator, Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was an ardent Unionist, observed it was &quot;contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/1707.shtml |title=Scottish Referendums |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the seat of the Scottish Parliament, demonstrators in Edinburgh feared the impact of its loss on the local economy. Elsewhere, there was widespread concern about the independence of the kirk, and possible tax rises.{{sfn|Bambery|2014|p=?}} 

As the Treaty passed through the Scottish Parliament, opposition was voiced by petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes. The [[Convention of Royal Burghs]] claimed 'we are not against an honourable and safe union with England', but 'the condition of the people of Scotland, (cannot be) improved without a Scots Parliament'.&lt;ref&gt; The Humble Address of the Commissioners to the General Convention of the Royal Burrows of this Ancient Kingdom Convened the Twenty-Ninth of October 1706, at Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Not one petition in favour of Union was received by Parliament. On the day the treaty was signed, the [[carillon]]er in [[St Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh, rang the bells in the tune ''Why should I be so sad on my wedding day?''&lt;ref&gt;Notes by [[John Purser]] to CD ''Scotland's Music'', [http://www.electricscotland.com/familytree/magazine/augsep2003/edinburgh.htm Facts about Edinburgh].&lt;/ref&gt; Threats of widespread civil unrest resulted in Parliament imposing [[martial law]].

==Treaty and passage of the 1707 Acts==
[[File:Articles of Union 1707.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Articles of Union otherwise known as Treaty of Union&quot;, 1707]]
Deeper political integration had been a key policy of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] from the time she acceded to the throne in 1702. Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.

Both countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations. Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials. At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]], the [[Earl of Seafield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;commissioners&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | title = The commissioners | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224021/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English commissioners included the [[Lord High Treasurer]], the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Earl of Godolphin]], the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]], [[William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper|Baron Cowper]], and a large number of Whigs who supported union. Tories were not in favour of union and only one was represented among the commissioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;commissioners&quot;/&gt;

Negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners took place between 16 April and 22 July 1706 at the [[Cockpit-in-Court|Cockpit]] in London. Each side had its own particular concerns. Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] dynasty would succeed Queen Anne to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | title = The course of negotiations | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090721014514/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | archivedate = 21 July 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments. In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] were supportive of the [[Court Party]]. For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]], led by the [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]] and the [[Duke of Roxburghe]]. Opponents of the court were generally known as the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country party]], and included various factions and individuals such as the [[Duke of Hamilton]], [[Lord Belhaven]] and [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]], who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union. The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the [[Darien Disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | title = Ratification | publisher = UK parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224031/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, the [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry|Duke of Queensberry]] was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action. He had received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster treasury for himself. In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road. From [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed. On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at [[Kensington Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | title = 1 May 1707 – the Union comes into effect | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224036/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Treaty of Union}}
The [[Treaty of Union]], agreed between representatives of the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature. In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees. Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706. To minimise the opposition of the [[Church of Scotland]], an Act was also passed to secure the [[Presbyterian]] establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy. The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.{{sfn|Riley|1969|pp=523–524}}

The two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send [[Scottish representative peers|representative peers]] from the [[Peerage of Scotland]] to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. It guaranteed that the [[Church of Scotland]] would remain the [[established church]] in Scotland, that the [[Court of Session]] would &quot;remain in all time coming within Scotland&quot;, and that [[Scots law]] would &quot;remain in the same force as before&quot;. Other provisions included the restatement of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the ban on [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] from taking the throne. It also created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]].

The Act provided that any &quot;laws and statutes&quot; that were &quot;contrary to or inconsistent with the terms&quot; of the Act would &quot;cease and become void&quot;.

===Related Acts===

The Scottish Parliament also passed the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707]] guaranteeing the status of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The English Parliament passed a similar Act, 6 Anne c.8.

Soon after the Union, the Act 6 Anne c.40{{mdash}}later named the [[Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707]]{{mdash}}united the English and Scottish [[Privy Council]]s and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration. In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the [[College of Justice]].

In the year following the Union, the [[Treason Act 1708]] abolished the Scottish law of [[High treason in the United Kingdom#History: after union with Scotland|treason]] and extended the corresponding English law across Great Britain.

Scotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining &quot;freedom of trade with England and the colonies&quot; as well as &quot;a great expansion of markets&quot;. The agreement guaranteed the permanent status of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, and the separate system of laws and courts in Scotland.  Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was

&lt;blockquote&gt;of inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations ... The sweeping successes of the eighteenth-century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;G.N. Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956) pp 290–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the time [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]] made their tour in 1773, recorded in ''[[A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland]]'', Johnson noted that Scotland was &quot;a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing&quot; and in particular that [[Glasgow]] had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Brown|title=My Scotland, Our Britain: A Future Worth Sharing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRz1AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150|year=2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster UK|page=150|isbn=9781471137518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 300th anniversary ==

[[File:2007£2union.jpg|thumb|The £2 coin issued in the United Kingdom in 2007 to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Acts of Union]]

A commemorative [[two-pound coin]] was issued to mark the tercentennial—300th anniversary—of the Union, which occurred two days before the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|Scottish Parliament general election]] on 3 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-11-06a.79.0 House of Lords – Written answers], 6 November 2006, TheyWorkForYou.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Government]] held a number of commemorative events through the year including an education project led by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]], an exhibition of Union-related objects and documents at the [[National Museums of Scotland]] and an exhibition of portraits of people associated with the Union at the [[National Galleries of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Announced by the Scottish Culture Minister, Patricia Ferguson, 9 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the functions of the Admiralty were transferred to a new [[Admiralty Board (United Kingdom)|Admiralty Board]], which is a committee of the tri-service [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom]] and part of the [[Navy Department (Ministry of Defence)|Navy Department]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Archives|first1=The National|title=Admiralty, and Ministry of Defence, Navy Department: Correspondence and Papers|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1710|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk|publisher=National Archives, 1660–1976, ADM 1|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].

The title of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom was vested in the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] from 1964 to 2011.

==History==
[[Image:Flag of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the Lord High Admiral]]

The office of Admiral of England (later Lord Admiral, and later [[List of Lord High Admirals (United Kingdom)|Lord High Admiral]]) was created around 1400; there had previously been Admirals of the [[Admiral of the North|northern]] and [[Admiral of the West|western]] seas. King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] established the Council of the Marine—later to become the [[Navy Board]]—in 1546, to oversee administrative affairs of the naval service. Operational control of the [[Royal Navy]] remained the responsibility of the Lord High Admiral, who was one of the nine [[Great Officers of State]]. This management approach would continue in force in the Royal Navy until to 1832.

King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission in 1628, and control of the Royal Navy passed to a committee in the form of the [[Board of Admiralty]]. The office of Lord High Admiral passed a number of times in and out of commission until 1709, after which the office was almost permanently in commission (the last Lord High Admiral being the future King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] in the early 19th century).

In this organization a dual system operated the Lord High Admiral (from 1546) then Commissioners of the Admiralty (from 1628) exercised the function of general control (military administration) of the Navy and they were usually responsible for the conduct of any war, while the actual supply lines, support and services were managed by four principal officers, namely, the [[Treasurer of the Navy|Treasurer]], [[Comptroller of the Navy (Navy Board)|Comptroller]], [[Surveyor of the Navy|Surveyor]] and [[Clerk of the Acts]], responsible individually for [[finance]], supervision of [[account (accountancy)|accounts]], [[Shipbuilding]] and maintenance of ships, and record of business. These principal officers came to be known as the [[Navy Board]] responsible for 'civil administration' of the navy, from 1546 to 1832.

This structure of administering the navy lasted for 285 years, however, the supply system was often inefficient and corrupt its deficiencies were due as much to its limitations of the times they operated in. The various functions within the Admiralty were not coordinated effectively and lacked inter-dependency with each other, with the result that in 1832, [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]] abolished the Navy Board and merged its functions within those of the Board of Admiralty. At the time this had distinct advantages; however, it failed to retain the principle of distinctions between the Admiralty and supply, and a lot of bureaucracy followed with the merger.

In 1860 saw big growth in the development of technical crafts, the expansion of more admiralty branches that really began with [[Naval tactics in the Age of Steam|age of steam]] that would have an enormous influence on the navy and naval thought. Between 1860 and 1908, there was no real study of strategy and of staff work conducted within the [[Her Majesty's Naval Service|naval service]]; it was practically ignored. All the Navy's talent flowed to the great technical universities. This school of thought for the next 50 years was exclusively technically based. The first serious attempt to introduce a sole management body to administer the naval service manifested itself in the creation of the [[Admiralty Navy War Council]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Paul|title=The War Plans of the Great Powers (RLE The First World War): 1880–1914|date=Apr 24, 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317702528|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dbtwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Admiral+Fisher+Naval+War+Council#v=onepage&amp;q=Admiral%20Fisher%20Naval%20War%20Council&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed by officials within the Admiralty at this time that the running of war was quite a simple matter for any flag officer who required no formal training. However, this mentality would be severely questioned with the advent of the [[Agadir crisis]], when the Admiralty's war plans were heavily criticized.

Following this, a new advisory body called the [[Admiralty War Staff]] was then instituted in 1912, headed by the Chief of the War Staff who was responsible for administering three new sub-divisions responsible for [[Operations Division|operations]], [[Naval Intelligence Division|intelligence]] and [[Mobilisation Division (Royal Navy)|mobilisation]]. The new War Staff had hardly found its feet and it continually struggled with the opposition to its existence by senior officers they were categorically opposed to a staff. The deficiencies of the system within this [[department of state]] could be seen in the conduct of the [[Dardanelles campaign]]. There were no mechanisms in place to answer the big strategic questions. A [[Trade Division (Royal Navy)|Trade Division]] was created in 1914. [[Sir John Jellicoe]] came to the Admiralty in 1916. He re-organized the war staff as following: Chief of War Staff, Operations, Intelligence, [[Signal Division (Royal Navy)|Signal Section]], Mobilisation, Trade.

It was not until 1917 that the admiralty department was again properly reorganized and began to function as a professional [[Staff (military)|military staff]]. In May 1917, the term &quot;Admiralty War Staff&quot; was renamed and that department and its functional role were superseded by a new &quot;[[Admiralty Naval Staff]]&quot;; in addition, the newly created office of Chief of the Naval Staff was merged in the office of the First Sea Lord. Also appointed was a new post, that of [[Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff (United Kingdom)|Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff]], and an [[Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff]]; all were given seats on the Board of Admiralty. This for the first time gave the [[Admiralty Naval Staff|naval staff]] direct representation on the board; the presence of three senior naval senior members on the board ensured the necessary authority to carry through any operation of war. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff would direct all operations and movements of the fleet, while the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff would be responsible for mercantile movements and anti-submarine operations.

The office of [[Third Sea Lord|Controller]] would be re-established to deal with all questions relating to supply; on 6 September 1917, a [[Deputy First Sea Lord]], was added to the Board who would administer operations abroad and deal with questions of foreign policy. In October 1917, the development of the staff was carried one step further by the creation of two sub-committees of the Board—the Operations Committee and the Maintenance Committee. The First Lord of the Admiralty was chairman of both committees, and the Operations Committee consisted of the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, the Deputy First Sea Lord, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff, and [[Fifth Sea Lord]]. The Maintenance Committee consisted of the Deputy First Sea Lord (representing the operations committee), [[Second Sea Lord]] (personnel), [[Third Sea Lord]] ([[materiel]]), [[Fourth Sea Lord]] (transport and stores), [[Civil Lord of the Admiralty (Royal Navy)|Civil Lord]], Controller and [[Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty|Financial Secretary]].

Full operational control of the Royal Navy was finally handed over to the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) by an [[order in Council]], effective October 1917, under which he became responsible for the issuing of orders affecting all [[Military operation|war operations]] directly to the fleet. It also empowered the CNS to issue orders in their own name, as opposed to them previously being issued by the [[Permanent Secretary of the Admiralty]] in the name of the Board. In 1964, the Admiralty—along with the [[War Office]] and the [[Air Ministry]]—were abolished as separate departments of state, and placed under one single new [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. Within the expanded Ministry of Defence are the new [[Admiralty Board (United Kingdom)|Admiralty Board]] which has a separate [[Navy Board (1964-present)|Navy Board]] responsible for the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy, the [[Army Board]] and the [[Air Force Board]], each headed by the [[Secretary of State for Defence]].  This structure remained in place until the department was abolished in 1964; the operational control and this system still remains in place with the Royal Navy today. For the organisational structure of the admiralty department and how it developed through the centuries see the following articles below.

==Organizational structure==
[[File:Board Room of Admiralty Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|[[Board of Admiralty]], about 1810]]

In the 20th century the structure of the Admiralty Headquarters was predominantly organized into four parts:&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Great Britain |first1=Parliament, House of Commons |title=House of Commons Papers, Volume 5 |date=1959 |publisher=HM Stationery Office |location=London, England |pages=5–24 |chapter=Admiralty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The [[Board of Admiralty]], which directs and controls the whole machine chaired by a civilian government minister the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. His chief military adviser was the [[First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff]] as the Senior Naval Lord to the board.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;
# The [[Admiralty Naval Staff]], advised and assisted the Board in chief strategic and operational planning, in the distributing of [[List of fleets and major commands of the Royal Navy|fleets and the allocating of assets to major naval commands and stations]] and in formulating official policy on tactical doctrine and requirements in regard to men and material. In order to deliver this the Naval Staff was organised into specialist Divisions and Sections. When the Admiralty unified with the Ministry of Defence in 1964 they were re designated as Directorates of the Naval Staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;
# The Admiralty Departments, which provides the men, ships, aircraft and supplies to carry out the approved policy. The departments are superintended by the various offices of the Sea Lords.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;
# The [[Department of the Permanent Secretary (Royal Navy)|Department of the Permanent Secretary]]  which was the general co-ordinating agency, regulating naval finance, providing advice on policy, conducing all correspondence on behalf of the Board and maintaining [[Admiralty Record Office|admiralty records]]. Its primary component to deliver this is the [[Admiralty Secretariat]], sections of the Secretariat (other than those which provide Common Services) were known as Branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

'''Board of Admiralty'''
{{main|Board of Admiralty}}
When the office of Lord High Admiral was in commission, as it was for most of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, until it reverted to [[the Crown]], it was exercised by a Board of Admiralty, officially known as the ''Commissioners for Exercising the Office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, &amp;c.'' (alternatively of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] or the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] depending on the period). The Board of Admiralty consisted of a number of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. The Lords Commissioners were always a mixture of [[admiral]]s, known as [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|Naval Lords or Sea Lords]] and Civil Lords, normally politicians. The [[quorum]] of the Board was two commissioners and a secretary. The president of the Board was known as the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], who was a member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. After 1806, the First Lord of the Admiralty was always a civilian, while the professional head of the navy came to be (and is still today) known as the [[First Sea Lord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

'''Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty (1628–1964)'''
{{main|Board of Admiralty}}
The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty were the members of The Board of Admiralty, which exercised the office of Lord High Admiral when it was not vested in a single person. The commissioners were a mixture of politicians without naval experience and professional naval officers, the proportion of naval officers generally increasing over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

'''Key Officials'''

'''First Lord of the Admiralty'''
{{main|First Lord of the Admiralty}}
The First Lord of the Admiralty or formally the Office of the First Lord of the Admiralty was the British government's senior civilian adviser on all naval affairs and the minister responsible for the direction and control of the [[Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office]] later the Department of Admiralty.(+) His office was supported by the [[Naval Secretary|Naval Secretariat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

'''First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff'''
{{main|First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff}}
The First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff was the Chief Naval Adviser on the Board of Admiralty to the First Lord and superintended the offices of the sea lords and the admiralty naval staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

'''Navy Board'''
{{main|Navy Board}}
The Navy Board was an independent board from 1546 until 1628 when it became subordinate to, yet autonomous of the Board of Admiralty until 1832. Its principal commissioners of the Navy advised the board in relation to civil administration of the naval affairs. The Navy Board was based at the [[Navy Office (Royal Navy)|Navy Office]].

It evolved from *[[Admiralty Navy War Council]], (1909–1912) which in turn became the [[Admiralty War Staff]], (1912–1917) before finally becoming the  Admiralty Naval Staff in 1917. It was the former senior command, operational planning, policy and strategy department within the British Admiralty. It was established in 1917 and existed until 1964 when the department of the Admiralty was abolished, and the staff departments function continued within the Navy Department of the Ministry of Defence until 1971 when its functions became part of the new Naval Staff, Navy Department of the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stationery Office|first1=H.M.|title=The Navy List|date=31 October 1967|publisher=Spink and Sons Ltd, London, England|pages=524–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admiralty Buildings==
[[File:Admiralty 1794 Draughtsman; Chawner, Thomas.jpg|thumb|right|The Admiralty complex in 1794. The colours indicate departments or residences for the several Lords of the Admiralty. The pale coloured extension behind the small courtyard, on the left is Admiralty House.]]
The Admiralty complex lies between [[Whitehall]], [[Horse Guards Parade]] and [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] and includes five inter-connected buildings. Since the Admiralty no longer exists as a department, these buildings are now used by separate government departments:

===The Admiralty===
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[The Admiralty]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Ripley Building]] --&gt;
The oldest building was long known simply as ''The Admiralty''; it is now known officially as the Ripley Building, a three-storey U-shaped brick building designed by [[Thomas Ripley (architect)|Thomas Ripley]] and completed in 1726. [[Alexander Pope]] implied the architecture is rather dull, lacking either the vigour of the [[baroque]] style, fading from fashion at the time, or the austere grandeur of the [[Palladian]] style just coming into vogue. It is mainly notable for being perhaps the first purpose-built office building in Great Britain. It contained the Admiralty board room, which is still used by the Admiralty, other state rooms,  offices and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. [[Robert Adam]] designed the screen, which was added to the entrance front in 1788. The Ripley Building is currently occupied by the [[Department for International Development]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Admiralty House===
[[Admiralty House, London|Admiralty House]] is a moderately proportioned mansion to the south of the Ripley Building, built in the late 18th century as the residence of the First Lord of the Admiralty from 1788. It served that purpose until 1964. [[Winston Churchill]] was one of its occupants in 1911–1915 and 1939–1940. It lacks its own entrance from Whitehall and is entered through the Ripley Courtyard or Ripley Building. It is a three-storey building in yellow brick with [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interiors. Its rear facade faces directly onto Horse Guards Parade. The architect was [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]]. The ground floor comprises meeting rooms for the Cabinet Office and the upper floors are three ministerial residences.

===Admiralty Extension===
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Admiralty Extension]] --&gt;
[[File:Admiralty Extension from Horse Guards Parade - Sept 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Admiralty Extension (which is also one of the two buildings which are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Old Admiralty&quot;) dates from the turn of the 20th century.]]
This is the largest of the Admiralty Buildings. It was begun in the late 19th century and redesigned while the construction was in progress to accommodate the extra offices needed by the naval arms race with the [[German Empire]]. It is a red brick building with white stone, detailing in the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] with French influences. It has been used by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] from the 1960s to 2016. The [[Department for Education]] planned to move into the building in September 2017 following the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's decision to leave the building and consolidate its London staff into one building on King Charles Street. A change of contractor (BAM was replaced by [[Willmott Dixon]]) delayed consolidation of the Department for Education to autumn 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2017/06/26/willmott-dixon-wins-old-admirality-building-refurb/|format=|title=Willmott Dixon wins Old Admirality [sic] Building refurb|website=constructionenquirer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{needs update|date=January 2020}}

===Admiralty Arch===
[[File:Admiralty Arch at Dusk, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|Admiralty Arch]]
[[Admiralty Arch]] is linked to the Old Admiralty Building by a bridge and is part of the ceremonial route from Trafalgar Square to [[Buckingham Palace]].  In 2012, [[HM Government]] sold the building on a 125-year lease for £60m for a proposed redevelopment into a Waldorf Astoria luxury hotel and four apartments.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

===The Admiralty Citadel===
This is a squat, windowless [[World War II]] fortress north west of Horse Guards Parade, now covered in [[ivy]]. See [[Military citadels under London]] for further details.

==&quot;Admiralty&quot; as a metonym for &quot;sea power&quot;==
[[File:Admiralty Citadel2008.jpg|thumb|right|Admiralty citadel|Bomb proof citadel constructed 1940 for Admiralty headquarters]]
In some cases, the term ''admiralty'' is used in a wider sense, as meaning ''[[Naval warfare|sea power]]'' or ''rule over the seas'', rather than in strict reference to the institution exercising such power. For example, the well-known lines from [[Kipling]]'s ''Song of the Dead'':

{{quote|If blood be the price of admiralty,

'''Amputation''' is the removal of a limb by [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[medical illness]], or [[surgery]]. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as [[cancer|malignancy]] or [[gangrene]]. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventive surgery for such problems. A special case is that of [[congenital amputation]], a [[congenital disorder]], where [[fetus|fetal]] limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts is or was used as a form of [[punishment]] for people who committed crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16854023|title=Proceedings of the 14th Annual History of Medicine Days| vauthors = Whitelaw WA |date=March 2005|website=Research Gate|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kocharkarn|first=Wachira | name-list-format = vanc |date=Summer 2000|title=Traumatic amputation of the penis|url=http://brazjurol.com.br/pdf/kochakarn_385_389.pdf|journal=Brazilian Journal of Urology|volume=26|pages=385–389|via=Official Journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Im95I7FjrvwC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=amputation+punishment#v=onepage&amp;q=amputation%20punishment&amp;f=false|title=Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law: Theory and Practice from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-First Century|last=Peters|first=Rudolph| name-list-format = vanc |date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521792264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury.

When done by a person, the person executing the amputation is an amputator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amputator|title=Definition of AMPUTATOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amputated person is called an amputee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amputee|title=Definition of AMPUTEE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the majority of new amputations occur due to complications of the vascular system (the blood vessels), especially from diabetes. Between 1988 and 1996, there were an average of 133,735 hospital discharges for amputation per year in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amputee-coalition.org/fact_sheets/amp_stats_cause.html |title=Amputee Coalition Factsheet |publisher=Amputee-coalition.org |date=2012-07-23 |access-date=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, just in the US, there were 1.6 million amputees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ziegler-Graham K, MacKenzie EJ, Ephraim PL, Travison TG, Brookmeyer R | title = Estimating the prevalence of limb loss in the United States: 2005 to 2050 | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 422–9 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18295618 | doi = 10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the US has 2.1 million amputees.

==Types==

=== Leg ===
Lower limb amputations can be divided into two broad categories: minor and major amputations. Minor amputations generally refer to the amputation of [[toe|digits]]. Major amputations are commonly below-knee- or above-knee amputations Common partial foot amputations include the [[François Chopart|Chopart]], [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|Lisfranc]], and ray amputations.

Common forms of ankle [[disarticulation]]s include Pyrogoff, Boyd, and Syme amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Pinzur|first = M. S.|displayauthors = etal|date = Sep 2003|title = Syme ankle disarticulation in patients with diabetes|journal = [[J. Bone Joint Surg. Am.]]|volume = 85|issue = 9|pages = 1667–1672|pmid = 12954823|doi = 10.2106/00004623-200309000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less common major amputation is the [[Van Nes rotation]], or rotationplasty, i.e. the turning around and [[replantation|reattachment]] of the foot to allow the ankle joint to take over the function of the knee.

Types of amputations include:
[[File:Diagram showing an above knee amputation CRUK 094.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|An above-knee amputation]]
; partial foot amputation: amputation of the lower limb distal to the ankle joint
; ankle disarticulation: amputation of the lower limb at the ankle joint
; trans-tibial amputation: amputation of the lower limb between the knee joint and the ankle joint, commonly referred to as a below-knee amputation
; knee disarticulation:{{anchor|BKA}} amputation of the lower limb at the knee joint
; trans-femoral amputation: amputation of the lower limb between the hip joint and the knee joint, commonly referred to an above-knee amputation
; hip disarticulation: amputation of the lower limb at the hip joint
; trans-pelvic disarticulation: amputation of the whole lower limb together with all or part of the pelvis, also known as a hemipelvectomy or hindquarter amputation

===Arm===
[[File:Amputations 18c.jpg|thumb|250px|The 18th century guide to amputations]]Types of upper extremity amputations include:

* partial hand amputation
* wrist disarticulation
* trans-radial amputation, commonly referred to as below-elbow or forearm amputation
* elbow disarticulation
* trans-humeral amputation, commonly referred to as above-elbow amputation
* shoulder disarticulation 
* [[forequarter amputation]]
A variant of the trans-radial amputation is the [[Krukenberg procedure]] in which the radius and ulna are used to create a stump capable of a pincer action.

===Other===
[[File:Index finger amputation.jpg|thumb|Partial amputation of [[index finger]].]]
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
* Facial amputations include but are not limited to:
** amputation of the ears
** amputation of the nose ([[rhinotomy]])
** amputation of the tongue ([[glossectomy]]).
** amputation of the eyes ([[enucleation of the eye|enucleation]]).
** amputation of the teeth.  Removal of teeth, mainly incisors, is or was practiced by some cultures for ritual purposes (for instance in the [[Iberomaurusian]] culture of [[Prehistoric Central North Africa|Neolithic North Africa]]).
* Breasts:
** amputation of the breasts ([[mastectomy]]).
*[[Genitals]]:
** amputation of the testicles ([[castration]]).
** amputation of the penis ([[penectomy]]).
** amputation of the [[foreskin]] ([[circumcision]]).
** amputation of the clitoris ([[clitoridectomy]]).

[[Hemicorporectomy]], or amputation at the waist, and [[decapitation]], or amputation at the neck, are the most radical amputations.

[[Genital modification and mutilation]] may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease.

===Self-amputation===
{{See also|Autotomy|Body integrity identity disorder}}

In some rare cases when a person has become trapped in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated his or her own limb. The most notable case of this is [[Aron Ralston]], a hiker who amputated his own right forearm after it was pinned by a boulder in a hiking accident and he was unable to free himself for over five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2003/07/climber-ralston-amputate-arm-utah/|title=Did Climber Have to Cut Off Arm to Save Life?|last=|first=|date=|website=National Geographic|access-date=5 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body integrity identity disorder]] is a psychological condition in which an individual feels compelled to remove one or more of their body parts, usually a limb.  In some cases, that individual may take drastic measures to remove the offending appendages, either by causing irreparable damage to the limb so that medical intervention cannot save the limb, or by causing the limb to be severed.

==Causes==

===Circulatory disorders===
* [[Diabetes|Diabetic]] vasculopathy
* [[Sepsis]] with peripheral necrosis
* [[Peripheral artery disease]] which can lead to [[Gangrene]]

===Neoplasm===
[[Image:1daypost.jpg|thumb|right|Transfemoral amputation due to [[liposarcoma]]]]
* Cancerous bone or soft tissue tumors (e.g. [[osteosarcoma]], [[chondrosarcoma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], [[epithelioid sarcoma]], [[Ewing's sarcoma]], [[synovial sarcoma]], [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]], [[liposarcoma]]), [[melanoma]]

===Trauma===
[[Image:World War I radiography amputee.jpg|thumb|Three fingers from a soldier's right hand were traumatically amputated during [[World War I]].]]

* Severe limb [[injury|injuries]] in which the limb cannot be saved or efforts to save the limb fail.
* [[Physical trauma|Traumatic]] amputation (an unexpected amputation that occurs at the scene of an accident, where the limb is partially or entirely severed as a direct result of the accident, for example, a finger that is severed from the blade of a table saw)
* Amputation in utero ([[Amniotic band]])

===Congenital anomalies===
* Deformities of digits and/or limbs (e.g., [[proximal femoral focal deficiency]], [[Fibular hemimelia]])
* Extra digits and/or limbs (e.g., [[polydactyly]])

===Infection===
* Bone infection ([[osteomyelitis]]) and/or diabetic foot infections
* [[Gangrene]]
* [[Trench foot]]
* [[Necrosis]]
* [[Meningococcal meningitis]]
* [[Streptococcus]]
* [[Vibrio vulnificus]]
* [[Necrotizing fasciitis]]
* [[Gas gangrene]]
* [[Legionella]]
* [[Influenza A Virus]]
* Animal bites
* [[Sepsis]]

=== Frostbite ===

Frostbite, also known as frostnip, happens when the individual's skin is exposed to cold weather for too long. The fluid in the pale skin solidifies, creating ice crystals, leading to swelling and severe pain. Other symptoms can include numbness, confusion, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, stiffness in the muscles or joints as well as difficulty walking. If the frostbite doesn't get treated soon, this process results in hypothermia, death or poisoning of the bloodstream.

This can affect the hands, feet, toes, fingers, eyes and face. Once the frostbite shuts the eyelids, this is known as snow blindness. The only way to stop it from spreading is through skin grafts or amputation.

===Athletic performance===
Sometimes professional [[Sportsperson|athletes]] may choose to have a non-essential digit amputated to relieve chronic pain and impaired performance. 
* Australian Rules footballer [[Daniel Chick]] elected to have his left [[ring finger]] amputated as chronic pain and injury was limiting his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/0122/aussierules.html |title=RTE: Aussie Rules star has finger removed |access-date=2007-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214022643/http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/0122/aussierules.html |archive-date=2007-12-14 |url-status=bot: unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Rugby union]] player [[Jone Tawake]] also had a finger removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Australian Rugby Union |url=http://www.sportsaustralia.com/articles/oct06/artid6659.html |title=Tawake undergoes surgery to remove finger |publisher=SportsAustralia.com |date=2006-10-17 |access-date=2013-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501093242/http://sportsaustralia.com/articles/oct06/artid6659.html |archive-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[National Football League]] [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] [[Ronnie Lott]] had the tip of his little finger removed after it was damaged in the [[1985 NFL season]].

===Legal punishment {{anchor|As a punishment in Islam}}===
* Amputation is used as a [[physical punishment|legal punishment]] in a number of countries, among them [[Legal system of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Legal system of Yemen|Yemen]], [[Legal system of the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], and [[Judicial system of Iran#Law|Iran]].

===Method===
{{howto|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Curvy amputation knife DSC09451.jpg|thumb|200px|Curved knives such as this one were used, in the past, for some kinds of amputations.]]
The first step is [[ligature (medicine)|ligating]] the supplying [[artery]] and [[vein]], to prevent [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding). The muscles are transected, and finally, the [[bone]] is sawed through with an [[oscillating saw]]. Sharp and rough edges of the bone(s) are filed down, skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump, occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a [[prosthesis]].

Distal stabilisation of muscles is recommended. This allows effective muscle contraction which reduces atrophy, allows functional use of the stump and maintains soft tissue coverage of the remnant bone. The preferred stabilisation technique is myodesis where the muscle is attached to the bone or its periosteum. In joint disarticulation amputations tenodesis may be used where the muscle tendon is attached to the bone. Muscles should be attached under similar tension to normal physiological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Smith DG |title=Atlas of Amputations and Limb Deficiencies: Surgical, Prosthetic and Rehabilitation Principles|date=2004|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|isbn=978-0892033133|pages=21–30|chapter=Chapter 2. General principles of amputation surgery.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experimental technique known as the &quot;Ewing amputation&quot; aims to improve post-amputation [[proprioception]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2018/04/13/stepping-strong-brigham-amputation How The Marathon Bombing Helped Bring Innovation To Amputation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brighamandwomensfaulkner.org/about-bwfh/news/ewing Jim Ewing, Dynamic-Model Amputation Patient ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920,&amp;nbsp; Professor Janos Ertl, Sr., MD, of Hungary, developed the Ertl procedure in order to return a high number of amputees to the work force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ertlreconstruction.com/|title=Ertl Reconstruction - amputation|website=www.ertlreconstruction.com|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ertl technique, an osteomyoplastic procedure for transtibial amputation, can be used to create a highly functional residual limb. Creation of a tibiofibular bone bridge provides a stable, broad tibiofibular articulation that may be capable of some distal weight bearing. Several different modified techniques and fibular bridge fixation methods have been used; however, no current evidence exists regarding comparison of the different techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischgrund|first=Jeffrey S.|date=June 2016|title=JAAOS Research|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|volume=24|issue=6|pages=392|doi=10.5435/jaaos-d-16-00309|pmid=27213622|issn=1067-151X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-operative management ===
The use of rigid removable dressings (RRD's) in trans-tibial (below knee) amputations, rather than soft bandaging has been shown to improve healing time, reduce edema, prevent knee flexion contractures and reduce complications, including further amputation, from external trauma such as falls onto the stump&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reichmann JP, Stevens PM, Rheinstein J, Kreulen CD | title = Removable Rigid Dressings for Postoperative Management of Transtibial Amputations: A Review of Published Evidence | journal = PM&amp;R | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 516–523 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29054690 | doi = 10.1016/j.pmrj.2017.10.002 | url =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; and should be considered standard practice.

Post-operative management, in addition to wound healing, should consider maintenance of limb strength, joint range, edema management, preservation of the intact limb (if applicable) and stump desensitisation.

== Trauma ==
Traumatic amputation is the partial or total avulsion of a part of a body during a serious accident, like traffic, labor, or combat.&lt;ref&gt;Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment: &quot;Amputations&quot;, editions Lange, USA, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Harry Gouvas: &quot;Accidents and Massive Disasters&quot;, editions of Greek Red Cross, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Watson: &quot;Hand Injuries and Infections&quot; Cower Medical Publishing, London, New York, 1996, {{ISBN|0-906923-80-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traumatic amputation of a human limb, either partial or total, creates the immediate danger of death from blood loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Harry Gouvas: &quot;Accidents and massive Disasters&quot;, Editions of Greek Red Cross, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthopedic surgeons often assess the severity of different injuries using the Mangled Extremity Severity Score. Given different clinical and situational factors, they can predict the likelihood of amputation. This is especially useful for emergency physicians to quickly evaluate patients and decide on consultations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansen K, Daines M, Howey T, Helfet D, Hansen ST | title = Objective criteria accurately predict amputation following lower extremity trauma | journal = The Journal of Trauma | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 568–72; discussion 572–3 | date = May 1990 | pmid = 2342140 | doi = 10.1097/00005373-199005000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
[[File:3372709503 10dc75d783 oSéquelleAmputation.jpg|thumb|170px|Private Lewis Francis was wounded July 21, 1861, at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] by a bayonet to the knee.]]
Traumatic amputation is uncommon in humans (1 per 20,804 population per year). Loss of limb usually happens immediately during the accident, but sometimes a few days later after medical complications. Statistically the most common causes of traumatic amputations are:&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
* Traffic accidents (cars, motorcycles, bicycles, trains, etc.)
* Labor accidents (equipment, instruments, cylinders, chainsaws, press machines, meat machines, wood machines, etc.)
* Agricultural accidents, with machines and mower equipment
* Electric shock hazards
* Firearms, bladed weapons, explosives
* Violent rupture of ship rope or industry wire rope
* Ring traction (ring amputation, de-gloving injuries)
* Building doors and car doors
* Animal attacks
* Gas cylinder explosions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scuba Tanks as Lethal Weapons|url=http://www.undercurrent.org/UCnow/dive_magazine/2011/LethalWeapons201102.html|website=undercurrent.org|access-date=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other rare accidents&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Treatment===
The development of the science of [[microsurgery]] over last 40 years has provided several treatment options for a traumatic amputation, depending on the patient's specific trauma and clinical situation:
* 1st choice: Surgical amputation - break - prosthesis
* 2nd choice: Surgical amputation - transplantation of other tissue - plastic reconstruction.
* 3rd choice: [[Replantation]] - reconnection - revascularisation of amputated limb, by microscope (after 1969)
* 4th choice: Transplantation of cadaveric hand (after 2000),&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Watson: &quot;Hand Injuries and Infections&quot;Cower Medical Publishing,{{ISBN|0-906923-80-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epidemiology===
* In the United States in 1999, there were 14,420 non-fatal traumatic amputations according to the [[American Statistical Association]]. Of these, 4,435 occurred as a result of traffic and transportation accidents and 9,985 were due to labor accidents. Of all traumatic amputations, the distribution percentage is 30.75% for traffic accidents and 69.24% for labor accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;amstat.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/ American Statistical Association: Amputations in USA, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The population of the United States in 1999 was about 300,000,000, so the conclusion is that there is one amputation per 20,804 persons per year. In the group of labor amputations, 53% occurred in laborers and technicians, 30% in production and service workers, 16% in silviculture and fishery workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;amstat.org&quot;/&gt;
* A study found that in 2010, 22.8% of patients undergoing amputation of a lower extremity in the United States were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A, Steiner C. ''Readmissions to U.S. Hospitals by Procedure, 2010.'' HCUP Statistical Brief #154. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. April 2013. [http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb154.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Methods in preventing amputation, [[limb-sparing techniques]], depend on the problems that might cause amputations to be necessary. Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or [[decubitus ulcers]] in bedridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation.

There are two key challenges: first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).
 
Crush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBOT). The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speed up recovery times and prevent infections.

A study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot achieved significant results in prevention of amputation in patients with diabetes and arterioscleorosis.&lt;ref name=dillon1&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouskela E, Donyo KA | title = Effects of oral administration of purified micronized flavonoid fraction on increased microvascular permeability induced by various agents and on ischemia/reperfusion in the hamster cheek pouch | journal = Angiology | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 391–9 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9158383 | doi = 10.1177/000331979704800503 | url = http://www.circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101125035502/http://circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2010-11-25 | access-date = 2010-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dillon2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dillon RS | title = Patient assessment and examples of a method of treatment.

For victims of trauma, advances in [[microsurgery]] in the 1970s have made replantations of severed body parts possible.

The establishment of laws, rules, and guidelines, and employment of modern equipment help protect people from traumatic amputations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The individual may experience psychological trauma and emotional discomfort. The stump will remain an area of reduced mechanical stability. Limb loss can present significant or even drastic practical limitations.

A large proportion of amputees (50–80%) experience the phenomenon of [[phantom limb]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2005 |title=The Science of Things | first = Heidi | last = Schultz | name-list-format = vanc |journal=National Geographic Magazine |url=http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0501/resources_who.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906143209/http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0501/resources_who.html |archive-date=September 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they feel body parts that are no longer there. These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye ([[phantom eye syndrome]]).

A similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, (''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'': [[V.S. Ramachandran]] and [[Sandra Blakeslee]]) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

In many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience [[proprioception]] of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of [[stump sock]]s may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.

Another side effect can be [[heterotopic ossification]], especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by [[improvised explosive device]]s in the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/26/MNSOLDIERS26.DTL |title=War without end / Damaged soldiers start their agonizing recoveries |first=Joan |last=Ryan |name-list-format=vanc |date=March 25, 2006 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208093622/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F03%2F26%2FMNSOLDIERS26.DTL |archive-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=June 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to technologic advances in prosthetics, many amputees live active lives with little restriction. Organizations such as the [[Challenged Athletes Foundation]] have been developed to give amputees the opportunity to be involved in athletics and [[adaptive sports]] such as [[Team Zaryen|Amputee Soccer]].

Nearly half of the individuals who have an amputation due to vascular disease will die within 5 years, usually secondary to the extensive co-morbidities rather than due to direct consequences of amputation. This is higher than the five year mortality rates for breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Jeffrey M.|last2=Strauss|first2=Gerald|last3=Aron|first3=David|last4=Long|first4=Jodi|last5=Kuba|first5=Jennifer|last6=Kaplan|first6=Yelena|date=November 2008|title=Mortality Rates and Diabetic Foot Ulcers|journal=Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association|volume=98|issue=6|pages=489–493|doi=10.7547/0980489|pmid=19017860|issn=8750-7315|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e804940ef6ce6111a99b545511ac10aa28c2ea1d}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of persons with diabetes who have a lower extremity amputation, up to 55% will require amputation of the second leg within two to three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Savage|first=P.

==Etymology==
The word amputation is derived from the [[Latin]] ''amputare'', &quot;to cut away&quot;, from ''ambi-'' (&quot;about&quot;, &quot;around&quot;) and ''putare'' (&quot;to prune&quot;). The English word “Poes” was first applied to surgery in the 17th century, possibly first in Peter Lowe's ''A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie'' (published in either 1597 or 1612); his work was derived from 16th-century French texts and early English writers also used the words &quot;extirpation&quot; (16th-century French texts tended to use ''extirper''), &quot;[[disarticulation]]&quot;, and &quot;[[dismemberment]]&quot; (from the Old French ''desmembrer'' and a more common term before the 17th century for limb loss or removal), or simply &quot;cutting&quot;, but by the end of the 17th century &quot;amputation&quot; had come to dominate as the accepted medical term.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[File:Wea00920.jpg|thumb|A hemispherical cup anemometer of the type invented in 1846 by [[Thomas Romney Robinson|John Thomas Romney Robinson]].]]

An '''anemometer''' is a device used for measuring [[wind speed]] and [[wind direction|direction]]. It is also a common [[weather station]] instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word ''anemos'', which means [[wind]], and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in [[meteorology]]. The first known description  of an anemometer was given by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1450.

==History==
The anemometer has changed little since its development in the 15th century. [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472) is said to have invented the first mechanical anemometer around 1450. In following centuries, numerous others, including [[Robert Hooke]]
(1635–1703), developed their own versions, with some being mistakenly credited as the inventor. In 1846, [[John Thomas Romney Robinson]] (1792–1882) improved upon the design by using four hemispherical cups and mechanical wheels. In 1926, Canadian meteorologist [[John Patterson (meteorologist)|John Patterson]] (January 3, 1872 – February 22, 1956) developed a three-cup anemometer, which was improved by Brevoort and Joiner in 1935. In 1991, [[Derek Weston]] added the ability to measure wind direction. In 1994, [[Andreas Pflitsch]] developed the sonic anemometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.windlogger.com/blogs/news/history-of-the-anemometer |title=History of the Anemometer|publisher=Logic Energy|date=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Velocity anemometers==

===Cup anemometers===
[[File:Cup-Anemometer-Animation.gif|thumb|right|Cup anemometer animation]]
A simple type of anemometer was invented in 1845 by Rev Dr [[John Thomas Romney Robinson]], of [[Armagh Observatory]]. It consisted of four [[hemispherical]] cups mounted on horizontal arms, which were mounted on a vertical shaft. The air flow past the cups in any horizontal direction turned the shaft at a rate that was roughly proportional to the wind speed. Therefore, counting the turns of the shaft over a set time interval produced a value proportional to the average wind speed for a wide range of speeds. It is also called a rotational anemometer.

On an anemometer with four cups, it is easy to see that since the cups are arranged symmetrically on the end of the arms, the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented to it and is blowing on the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross. Since a hollow hemisphere has a [[drag coefficient]] of .38 on the spherical side and 1.42 on the hollow side,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://ia600707.us.archive.org/13/items/FluidDynamicDragHoerner1965/Fluid-dynamic_drag__Hoerner__1965.pdf#page=60&amp;zoom=auto,-77,435 |title=Sighard Hoerner's Fluid Dynamic Drag|pages=3–17, Figure 32|date=1965}} (pg 60 of 455) &lt;/ref&gt; more force is generated on the cup that is presenting its hollow side to the wind. Because of this asymmetrical force, torque is generated on the axis of the anemometer, causing it to spin.

Theoretically, the speed of rotation of the anemometer should be proportional to the wind speed, because the force produced on an object is proportional to the speed of the fluid flowing past it, but other factors influence the rotational speed, including turbulence produced by the apparatus, increasing drag in opposition to the torque that is produced by the cups and support arms, and friction of the mount point. When Robinson first designed his anemometer, he asserted that the cups moved one-third of the speed of the wind, unaffected by the cup size or arm length. This was apparently confirmed by some early independent experiments, but it was incorrect. Instead, the ratio of the speed of the wind and that of the cups, the ''anemometer factor'', depends on the dimensions of the cups and arms, and may have a value between two and a little over three. Every previous experiment involving an anemometer had to be repeated after the error was discovered.

The three-cup anemometer developed by the Canadian [[John Patterson (meteorologist)|John Patterson]] in 1926 and subsequent cup improvements by Brevoort &amp; Joiner of the United States in 1935 led to a cupwheel design with a nearly linear response and had an error of less than 3% up to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Patterson found that each cup produced maximum torque when it was at 45° to the wind flow. The three-cup anemometer also had a more constant torque and responded more quickly to gusts than the four-cup anemometer.

The three-cup anemometer was further modified by the Australian Dr. Derek Weston in 1991 to measure both wind direction and wind speed. Weston added a tag to one cup, which causes the cupwheel speed to increase and decrease as the tag moves alternately with and against the wind. Wind direction is calculated from these cyclical changes in cupwheel speed, while wind speed is determined from the average cupwheel speed.

Three-cup anemometers are currently used as the industry standard for [[wind resource assessment]] studies &amp; practice.

===Vane anemometers===
One of the other forms of mechanical velocity anemometer is the ''vane anemometer''. It may be described as a [[windmill]] or a propeller anemometer. Unlike the Robinson anemometer, whose axis of rotation is vertical, the vane anemometer must have its axis parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes, a [[weather vane|wind vane]] or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed.

A ''vane anemometer'' thus combines a propeller and a tail on the same axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument.&lt;ref name= WMO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/rapid_cyclo/www/english/glossary/vaneanem.htm|title=Vane anemometer|author=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|work=Eumetcal|access-date=6 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408221107/http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/rapid_cyclo/www/english/glossary/vaneanem.htm|archive-date=8 April 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of the fan is measured by a rev counter and converted to a windspeed by an electronic chip. Hence, volumetric flow rate may be calculated if the cross-sectional area is known.

In cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same, as in ventilating shafts of mines and buildings, wind vanes known as air meters are employed, and give satisfactory results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Various|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUFjDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP8&amp;ots=sJUszaqUtG&amp;dq=In%20cases%20where%20the%20direction%20of%20the%20air%20motion%20is%20always%20the%20same,%20as%20in%20ventilating%20shafts%20of%20mines%20and%20buildings,%20wind%20vanes%20known%20as%20air%20meters%20are%20employed,%20and%20give%20satisfactory%20results.&amp;pg=PP8#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20cases%20where%20the%20direction%20of%20the%20air%20motion%20is%20always%20the%20same,%20as%20in%20ventilating%20shafts%20of%20mines%20and%20buildings,%20wind%20vanes%20known%20as%20air%20meters%20are%20employed,%20and%20give%20satisfactory%20results.&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 2, Part 1, Slice 1|date=2018-01-01|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hot-wire anemometers===
[[File:Hd sonde.jpg|thumb|left|Hot-wire sensor]]
Hot wire anemometers use a fine wire (on the order of several micrometres) electrically heated to some temperature above the ambient. Air flowing past the wire cools the wire. As the electrical resistance of most metals is dependent upon the temperature of the metal ([[tungsten]] is a popular choice for hot-wires), a relationship can be obtained between the resistance of the wire and the flow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efunda.com/designstandards/sensors/hot_wires/hot_wires_intro.cfm|title=Hot-wire Anemometer explanation|publisher=eFunda|access-date=18 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010125307/http://www.efunda.com/DesignStandards/sensors/hot_wires/hot_wires_intro.cfm |archivedate=10 October 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, they cannot be used to measure wind direction, unless coupled with a wind vane.

Several ways of implementing this exist, and hot-wire devices can be further classified as CCA ([[constant current]] anemometer), CVA ([[Voltage source|constant voltage]] anemometer) and CTA (constant-temperature anemometer). The voltage output from these anemometers is thus the result of some sort of circuit within the device trying to maintain the specific variable (current, voltage or temperature) constant, following [[Ohm's law]].

Additionally, PWM ([[pulse-width modulation]]) anemometers are also used, wherein the velocity is inferred by the time length of a repeating pulse of current that brings the wire up to a specified resistance and then stops until a threshold &quot;floor&quot; is reached, at which time the pulse is sent again.

Hot-wire anemometers, while extremely delicate, have extremely high frequency-response and fine spatial resolution compared to other measurement methods, and as such are almost universally employed for the detailed study of turbulent flows, or any flow in which rapid velocity fluctuations are of interest.

An industrial version of the fine-wire anemometer is the [[Thermal mass flow meter|thermal flow meter]], which follows the same concept, but uses two pins or strings to monitor the variation in temperature. The strings contain fine wires, but encasing the wires makes them much more durable and capable of accurately measuring air, gas, and emissions flow in pipes, ducts, and stacks. Industrial applications often contain dirt that will damage the classic hot-wire anemometer.

[[File:Laser anemometer.png|thumb|360px|Drawing of a laser anemometer. The laser light is emitted (1) through the front lens (6) of the anemometer and is backscattered off the air molecules (7). The backscattered radiation (dots) re-enters the device and is reflected and directed into a detector (12).]]

===Laser Doppler anemometers===
In [[laser Doppler velocimetry]], laser Doppler anemometers use a beam of light from a [[laser]] that is divided into two beams, with one propagated out of the anemometer. Particulates (or deliberately introduced seed material) flowing along with air molecules near where the beam exits reflect, or backscatter, the light back into a detector, where it is measured relative to the original laser beam. When the particles are in great motion, they produce a [[Doppler shift]] for measuring wind speed in the laser light, which is used to calculate the speed of the particles, and therefore the air around the anemometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iten|first=Paul D.|date=29 June 1976|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=3966324|title=Laser Doppler Anemometer|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|access-date=18 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ultrasonic Windsensor.png|thumb|2D ultrasonic anemometer with 3 paths]]

===Ultrasonic anemometers===
[[File:WindMaster.jpg|thumb|3D ultrasonic anemometer]]
Ultrasonic anemometers, first developed in the 1950s, use [[ultrasound|ultrasonic sound waves]] to measure wind velocity. They measure wind speed based on the time of flight of sonic pulses between pairs of [[transducer]]s. Measurements from pairs of transducers can be combined to yield a measurement of velocity in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional flow. The [[spatial resolution]] is given by the path length between transducers, which is typically 10 to 20 [[centimeter|cm]]. Ultrasonic anemometers can take measurements with very fine [[temporal resolution]], 20 [[hertz|Hz]] or better, which makes them well suited for [[turbulence]] measurements. The lack of moving parts makes them appropriate for long-term use in exposed automated weather stations and weather buoys where the accuracy and reliability of traditional cup-and-vane anemometers are adversely affected by salty air or dust. Their main disadvantage is the distortion of the air flow by the structure supporting the transducers, which requires a correction based upon wind tunnel measurements to minimize the effect. An international standard for this process, [[ISO 16622]] ''Meteorology—Ultrasonic anemometers/thermometers—Acceptance test methods for mean wind measurements'' is in general circulation. Another disadvantage is lower accuracy due to precipitation, where rain drops may vary the [[speed of sound]].

Since the speed of sound varies with temperature, and is virtually stable with pressure change, ultrasonic anemometers are also used as [[thermometers]].

Two-dimensional (wind speed and wind direction) sonic anemometers are used in applications such as [[weather station]]s, ship navigation, aviation, [[weather buoy]]s and wind turbines. Monitoring wind turbines usually requires a refresh rate of wind speed measurements of 3&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giebhardt |first=Jochen |editor-last1=Dalsgaard Sørensen |editor-first1=John |editor-last2=N Sørensen |editor-first2=Jens |title=Wind Energy Systems: Optimising design and construction for safe and reliable operation |publisher=Elsevier |date=December 20, 2010 |pages=329–349 |chapter=Chapter 11: Wind turbine condition monitoring systems and techniques |isbn=9780857090638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; easily achieved by sonic anemometers. Three-dimensional sonic anemometers are widely used to measure gas emissions and ecosystem fluxes using the [[eddy covariance]] method when used with fast-response [[infrared gas analyzer]]s or [[laser]]-based analyzers.

Two-dimensional wind sensors are of two types:
* '''Two ultrasounds paths''': These sensors have four arms. The disadvantage of this type of sensor is that when the wind comes in the direction of an ultrasound path, the arms disturb the airflow, reducing the accuracy of the resulting measurement.
* '''Three ultrasounds paths''': These sensors have three arms. They give one path redundancy of the measurement which improves the sensor accuracy and reduces aerodynamic turbulence.

====Acoustic resonance anemometers====
[[File:Acoustic Resonance Wind Sensor.jpg|thumb|left|Acoustic resonance anemometer]]
Acoustic resonance anemometers are a more recent variant of sonic anemometer. The technology was invented by Savvas Kapartis and patented in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Kapartis, Savvas (1999) &quot;Anemometer employing standing wave normal to fluid flow and travelling wave normal to standing wave&quot; {{US Patent|5877416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas conventional sonic anemometers rely on time of flight measurement, acoustic resonance sensors use resonating acoustic (ultrasonic) waves within a small purpose-built cavity in order to perform their measurement.

[[File:Acoustic Resonance Anemometer.jpg|thumb|Acoustic resonance principle]]
Built into the cavity is an array of ultrasonic transducers, which are used to create the separate standing-wave patterns at ultrasonic frequencies. As wind passes through the cavity, a change in the wave's property occurs (phase shift). By measuring the amount of phase shift in the received signals by each transducer, and then by mathematically processing the data, the sensor is able to provide an accurate horizontal measurement of wind speed and direction.

Acoustic resonance technology enables measurement within a small cavity, the sensors therefore tend to be typically smaller in size than other ultrasonic sensors. The small size of acoustic resonance anemometers makes them physically strong and easy to heat and therefore resistant to icing. This combination of features means that they achieve high levels of data availability and are well suited to wind turbine control and to other uses that require small robust sensors such as battlefield meteorology. One issue with this sensor type is measurement accuracy when compared to a calibrated mechanical sensor. For many end uses, this weakness is compensated for by the sensor's longevity and the fact that it does not require re-calibrating once installed.

===Ping-pong ball anemometers===
A common anemometer for basic use is constructed from a [[ping-pong ball]] attached to a string. When the wind blows horizontally, it presses on and moves the ball; because ping-pong balls are very lightweight, they move easily in light winds. Measuring the angle between the string-ball apparatus and the vertical gives an estimate of the wind speed.

This type of anemometer is mostly used for middle-school level instruction, which most students make on their own, but a similar device was also flown on [[Phoenix Mars Lander#Meteorological station|Phoenix Mars Lander]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://marslab.au.dk/research/instrument-development/the-telltale-project/ &quot;The Telltale project.&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220080017/http://www.marslab.dk/TelltaleProject.html |date=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pressure anemometers==
[[File:Britannia Yacht Club tour, burgee, and wind gauge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Britannia Yacht Club]] clubhouse tour, burgee, and wind gauge on roof]]
The first designs of anemometers that measure the pressure were divided into plate and tube classes.

===Plate anemometers===
These are the first modern anemometers. They consist of a flat plate suspended from the top so that the wind deflects the plate. In 1450, the Italian art architect Leon Battista Alberti invented the first mechanical anemometer; in 1664 it was re-invented by Robert Hooke (who is often mistakenly considered the inventor of the first anemometer). Later versions of this form consisted of a flat plate, either square or circular, which is kept normal to the wind by a wind vane. The pressure of the wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The compression of the spring determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate, and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or on a recorder. Instruments of this kind do not respond to light winds, are inaccurate for high wind readings, and are slow at responding to variable winds. Plate anemometers have been used to trigger high wind alarms on bridges.

===Tube anemometers===

[[File:Pitot tube static anemometer.JPG|thumb|The pointed head is the pitot port. The small holes are connected to the static port.]]

[[James Lind (1736–1812)|James Lind]]'s anemometer of 1775 consisted of a glass U tube containing a liquid [[manometer]] (pressure gauge), with one end bent in a horizontal direction to face the wind and the other vertical end remains parallel to the wind flow. Though the Lind was not the first it was the most practical and best known anemometer of this type. If the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an increase of pressure on one side of the manometer. The wind over the open end of a vertical tube causes little change in pressure on the other side of the manometer. The resulting elevation difference in the two legs of the U tube is an indication of the wind speed. However, an accurate measurement requires that the wind speed be directly into the open end of the tube; small departures from the true direction of the wind causes large variations in the reading.

The successful metal pressure tube anemometer of William Henry Dines in 1892 utilized the same pressure difference between the open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind and a ring of small holes in a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end. Both are mounted at the same height. The pressure differences on which the action depends are very small, and special means are required to register them. The recorder consists of a float in a sealed chamber partially filled with water. The pipe from the straight tube is connected to the top of the sealed chamber and the pipe from the small tubes is directed into the bottom inside the float. Since the pressure difference determines the vertical position of the float this is a measure of the wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anemometer Comparisons|first=W. H.|last=Dines|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|date=1892|volume=18|issue=83|page=168|url=https://ia800208.us.archive.org/24/items/quarterlyjourna33britgoog/quarterlyjourna33britgoog.pdf#page=195&amp;zoom=auto,-136,736 |accessdate=14 July 2014|doi=10.1002/qj.4970188303|bibcode=1892QJRMS..18..165D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great advantage of the tube anemometer lies in the fact that the exposed part can be mounted on a high pole, and requires no oiling or attention for years; and the registering part can be placed in any convenient position. Two connecting tubes are required. It might appear at first sight as though one connection would serve, but the differences in pressure on which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the chimney, an effect may be produced equal to a wind of 10&amp;nbsp;mi/h (16&amp;nbsp;km/h); and the opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may entirely alter the registration.

While the Dines anemometer had an error of only 1% at {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, it did not respond very well to low winds due to the poor response of the flat plate vane required to turn the head into the wind. In 1918 an aerodynamic vane with eight times the torque of the flat plate overcame this problem.

====Pitot tube static anemometers====
Modern tube anemometers use the same principle as in the Dines anemometer but using a different design. The implementation uses a [[pitot tube|pitot-static tube]] which is a pitot tube with two ports, pitot and static, that is normally used in measuring the airspeed of aircraft. The pitot port measures the dynamic pressure of the open mouth of a tube with pointed head facing wind, and the static port measures the static pressure from small holes along the side on that tube. The pitot tube is connected to a tail so that it always makes the tube's head to face the wind. Additionally, the tube is heated to prevent [[rime ice]] formation on the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Instrumentation: Pitot Tube Static Anemometer, Part 1|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/clarkb/instrumentation/14828|publisher=Mt. Washington Observatory|access-date=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714135450/http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/clarkb/instrumentation/14828|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two lines from the tube down to the devices to measure the difference in pressure of the two lines. The measurement devices can be [[manometer]]s, [[pressure transducer]]s, or analog [[chart recorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Instrumentation: Pitot Tube Static Anemometer, Part 2|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/clarkb/instrumentation-1/15065|publisher=Mt. Washington Observatory|access-date=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714232314/http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/clarkb/instrumentation-1/15065|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of density on measurements===
In the tube anemometer the dynamic pressure is actually being measured, although the scale is usually graduated as a velocity scale. If the actual air density differs from the calibration value, due to differing temperature, elevation or barometric pressure, a correction is required to obtain the actual wind speed. Approximately 1.5% (1.6% above 6,000 feet) should be added to the velocity recorded by a tube anemometer for each 1000&amp;nbsp;ft (5% for each kilometer) above sea-level.

==Effect of icing==
At airports, it is essential to have accurate wind data under all conditions, including freezing precipitation. Anemometry is also required in monitoring and controlling the operation of wind turbines, which in cold environments are prone to in-cloud icing. Icing alters the aerodynamics of an anemometer and may entirely block it from operating. Therefore, anemometers used in these applications must be internally heated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0426(2001)018&lt;1457:AIIC&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=2001|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1457|bibcode=2001JAtOT..18.1457M|title=Anemometry in Icing Conditions|journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology|last1=Makkonen|first1=Lasse|last2=Lehtonen|first2=Pertti|last3=Helle|first3=Lauri}} {{free access}} &lt;/ref&gt; Both cup anemometers and sonic anemometers are presently available with heated versions.

==Instrument location==
In order for wind speeds to be comparable from location to location, the effect of the terrain needs to be considered, especially in regard to height. Other considerations are the presence of trees, and both natural canyons and artificial canyons (urban buildings). The standard anemometer height in open rural terrain is 10 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oke|first=Tim R.|title=Initial Guidance to Obtain Representative Meteorological Observations At Urban Sites|chapter-url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/IOM-81/IOM-81-UrbanMetObs.pdf#page=23&amp;zoom=auto,-16,235 |accessdate=4 February 2013|series=Instruments and Observing Methods|volume=81|year=2006|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|pages=19–26|chapter=3.5 Wind speed and direction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Archaeopteryx''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑːr|k|iː|ˈ|ɒ|p|t|ər|ᵻ|k|s}}, {{trans|'old wing'}}; sometimes referred to by its German name '''''{{lang|de|Urvogel}}''''' ({{trans|'original bird' or 'first bird'}})), is a [[genus]] of bird-like [[dinosaur]]s that is [[transitional fossil|transitional]] between non-avian [[feathered dinosaur]]s and modern [[bird]]s. The name derives from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀρχαῖος|ἀρχαῖος]]}} (''archaīos'') meaning &quot;ancient&quot;, and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πτέρυξ|πτέρυξ]]}} (''ptéryx''), meaning &quot;feather&quot; or &quot;wing&quot;. Between the late 19th century and the early 21st century, ''Archaeopteryx'' had been generally accepted by [[Paleontology|palaeontologists]] and popular reference books as the oldest known bird (member of the group [[Avialae]]).&lt;ref name=Xiaotingia&gt;{{cite journal |title=An ''Archaeopteryx''-like theropod from China and the origin of Avialae |url=http://www.ivpp.ac.cn/qt/papers/201403/P020140314389417822583.pdf |date=28 July 2011 |journal=Nature |volume=475 |pages=465–470 |doi=10.1038/nature10288 |issue=7357 |pmid=21796204 |last1=Xu |first1=X |last2=You |first2=H |last3=Du |first3=K |last4=Han |first4=F |access-date=5 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220071919/http://www.ivpp.ac.cn/qt/papers/201403/P020140314389417822583.pdf |archive-date=20 December 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older potential avialans have since been identified, including ''[[Anchiornis]]'', ''[[Xiaotingia]]'', and ''[[Aurornis]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

''Archaeopteryx'' lived in the [[Late Jurassic]] around 150&amp;nbsp;million years ago, in what is now southern Germany during a time when Europe was an archipelago of islands in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the [[equator]] than it is now. Similar in size to a [[Eurasian magpie]], with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a [[raven]],&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt; the largest species of ''Archaeopteryx'' could grow to about {{convert|0.5|m|abbr=on}} in length. Despite their small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, ''Archaeopteryx'' had more in common with other small [[Mesozoic]] [[dinosaur]]s than with modern birds. In particular, they shared the following features with the [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] and [[troodontidae|troodontids]]: jaws with sharp [[Tooth|teeth]], three fingers with [[claw]]s, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes (&quot;killing claw&quot;), feathers (which also suggest [[homeothermy|warm-bloodedness]]), and various features of the [[skeleton]].&lt;ref name=Yalden_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCal_Chiappe/&gt;

These features make ''Archaeopteryx'' a clear candidate for a [[transitional fossil]] between non-avian dinosaurs and birds.&lt;ref name=UCal_MoP/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCalg_Long/&gt; Thus, ''Archaeopteryx'' plays an important role, not only in the study of the [[origin of birds]], but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a single [[feather]] in 1861,&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; though that feather would eventually prove to be non-avian.&lt;ref name=feather/&gt; That same year, the first complete specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of ''Archaeopteryx'' have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.

Most of these eleven fossils include impressions of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form ([[flight feather]]s), these fossils are evidence that the evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic.&lt;ref name=weln_04/&gt; The [[type specimen]] of ''Archaeopteryx'' was discovered just two years after [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. ''Archaeopteryx'' seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of [[evolution]].

In March 2018, scientists reported that ''Archaeopteryx'' was likely capable of [[Bird flight|flight]], but in a manner distinct and substantially different from that of [[Birds|modern birds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NAT-20180313&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Voeten, Dennis F.A.E.|display-authors=et al |title=Wing bone geometry reveals active flight in Archaeopteryx |date=13 March 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=9 |pages=923 |number=923 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-03296-8 |pmid=29535376 |pmc=5849612 |bibcode=2018NatCo...9..923V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WP-20180313&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Guarino |first=Ben |title=This feathery dinosaur probably flew, but not like any bird you know |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/03/13/this-feathery-dinosaur-probably-flew-but-not-like-any-bird-you-know/ |date=13 March 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=13 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' that have been discovered come from the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, southern Germany, which is a lagerstätte, a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils laid down during the early Tithonian stage of the Jurassic period,&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt; approximately 150.8–148.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schweigert | first1 = G. | year = 2007 | title = Ammonite biostratigraphy as a tool for dating Upper Jurassic lithographic limestones from South Germany – first results and open questions | url = | journal = Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie - Abhandlungen | volume = 245 | issue = 1| pages = 117–125 | doi = 10.1127/0077-7749/2007/0245-0117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Archaeopteryx'' was roughly the size of a [[raven]],&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt; with broad wings that were rounded at the ends and a long tail compared to its body length. It could reach up to {{convert|500|mm|in}} in body length, with an estimated mass of {{convert|0.8|to|1|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' feathers, although less documented than its other features, were very similar in structure to modern-day bird feathers.&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt; Despite the presence of numerous avian features,&lt;ref name=Holtz/&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' had many non-avian [[theropoda|theropod dinosaur]] characteristics. Unlike modern birds, ''Archaeopteryx'' had small teeth,&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt; as well as a long bony tail, features which ''Archaeopteryx'' shared with other dinosaurs of the time.&lt;ref name=Paleogeo/&gt;

Because it displays features common to both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, ''Archaeopteryx'' has often been considered a link between them.&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt; In the 1970s, [[John Ostrom]], following [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and ''Archaeopteryx'' was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the [[Talus bone|ankle bone]], [[interdental plate]]s, an [[obturator foramen|obturator]] process of the [[ischium]], and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that ''Archaeopteryx'' was remarkably similar to the theropod family [[Dromaeosauridae]].&lt;ref name=Buhler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley_2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley_3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nedin_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olson_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ostrom_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ostrom_2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Owen_1/&gt;

[[File:Archaeopteryx-modern bird tails.png|thumb|left|Anatomical illustration comparing the &quot;frond-tail&quot; of ''Archaeopteryx'' with the &quot;fan-tail&quot; of a modern bird]]
Specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' were most notable for their well-developed [[flight feather]]s. They were markedly asymmetrical and showed the structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a [[barb (feather)|barb]]-[[barbule]]-barbicel arrangement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feduc 2&quot;/&gt; The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again in line with the situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The [[thumb]] did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of [[alula|stiff feathers]].

The body plumage of ''Archaeopteryx'' is less well documented and has only been properly researched in the well-preserved [[The Berlin specimen|Berlin specimen]]. Thus, as more than one species seems to be involved, the research into the Berlin specimen's feathers does not necessarily hold true for the rest of the species of ''Archaeopteryx''. In the Berlin specimen, there are &quot;trousers&quot; of well-developed feathers on the legs; some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure, but are somewhat decomposed (they lack [[barbicel]]s as in [[ratite]]s).&lt;ref name=Christ_Bond_04/&gt; In part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight.&lt;ref name=Longrich_1/&gt;

A patch of [[pennaceous feather]]s is found running along its back, which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm, although not as stiff as the flight-related feathers. Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of &quot;proto-[[Down feather|down]]&quot; not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur ''[[Sinosauropteryx]]'': decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appearing more like fur than feathers in life (although not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body—although some feathers did not fossilize and others were obliterated during preparation, leaving bare patches on specimens—and the lower neck.&lt;ref name=Christ_Bond_04/&gt;

There is no indication of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most ''Archaeopteryx'' specimens became embedded in [[Oxygen saturation|anoxic]] sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, which suggests that the specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape ([[death pose]]) of the fossil specimens was achieved.&lt;ref name=reisdorf2012&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reisdorf, A.

&lt;/ref&gt; This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.&lt;ref name=Elzanowski2002/&gt;

In 2011, graduate student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an ''Archaeopteryx'' specimen.&lt;ref name=&quot;NatureComm&quot; /&gt; Using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] technology and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy-dispersive X-ray]] analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of [[melanosome]]s in the isolated feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant measurements were then compared to those of 87&amp;nbsp;modern bird species, and the original colour was calculated with a 95% likelihood to be black. The feather was determined to be black throughout, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tip. The feather studied was most probably a dorsal [[Covert (feather)|covert]], which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The study does not mean that ''Archaeopteryx'' was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Switek| first = Brian| title = Archaeopteryx was robed in black | newspaper = New Scientist| location = Las Vegas| date = 9 November 2011| url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21146-archaeopteryx-was-robed-in-black.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 study published in the ''Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry'', new analyses of ''Archaeopteryx'''s feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex light- and dark-coloured plumage, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tips and outer vanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Manning, Phillip.

=== Flight ===
[[File:Vog1h.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1880 photo of the Berlin specimen, showing leg feathers that were removed subsequently, during preparation]]
&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindhe_50:921/&gt; --&gt;As in the wings of modern birds, the flight feathers of ''Archaeopteryx'' were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but it is unclear whether ''Archaeopteryx'' was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony [[Sternum|breastbone]] suggests that ''Archaeopteryx'' was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike [[coracoid]]s, or perhaps, to a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[sternum]]. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between [[scapula]], coracoid, and [[humerus]]—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that ''Archaeopteryx'' was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by [[Philip Senter]] in 2006, ''Archaeopteryx'' was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.&lt;ref name=senter_1/&gt; However, a more recent study solves this issue by suggesting a different flight stroke configuration for non-avian flying theropods.&lt;ref&gt;Voeten, Dennis F.A.E.; et al. (13 March 2018). “Wing bone geometry reveals active flight in Archaeopteryx”. Nature Communications. 9 (923). Bibcode:2018NatCo…9..923V. doi:10.1038/s41467–018–03296–8. Retrieved 13 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Archaeopteryx'' wings were relatively large, which would have resulted in a low stall speed and reduced [[turning radius]]. The short and rounded shape of the wings would have increased drag, but also could have improved its ability to fly through cluttered environments such as trees and brush (similar wing shapes are seen in birds that fly through trees and brush, such as [[crows]] and [[pheasant]]s). The presence of &quot;hind wings&quot;, asymmetrical flight feathers stemming from the legs similar to those seen in dromaeosaurids such as ''[[Microraptor]]'', also would have added to the aerial mobility of ''Archaeopteryx''. The first detailed study of the hind wings by Longrich in 2006, suggested that the structures formed up to 12% of the total [[airfoil]]. This would have reduced stall speed by up to 6% and turning radius by up to 12%.&lt;ref name=Longrich_1/&gt;

The feathers of ''Archaeopteryx'' were asymmetrical. This has been interpreted as evidence that it was a flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that the feathers of ''Archaeopteryx'' fall into this range.&lt;ref name=speakmanthomson1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Speakman |first=J.

In 2010, Robert L. Nudds and Gareth J. Dyke in the journal ''Science'' published a paper in which they analysed the [[rachis]]es of the primary feathers of ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' and ''Archaeopteryx''. The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those of modern birds relative to body mass. The authors determined that ''Archaeopteryx'' and ''Confuciusornis'', were unable to use flapping flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nudds&amp;Dyke2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Nudds, Robert L. |author2=Dyke, Gareth J.|date=14 May 2010|title=Narrow Primary Feather Rachises in ''Confuciusornis'' and ''Archaeopteryx'' Suggest Poor Flight Ability|journal=Science|volume=328|issue=5980|pages=887–889|doi=10.1126/science.1188895|pmid=20466930|bibcode = 2010Sci...328..887N |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/07d18c3e8e9a6fa234be5e333655f9332ded7373}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was criticized by [[Philip J. Currie]] and Luis Chiappe. Chiappe suggested that it is difficult to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers, and Currie speculated that ''Archaeopteryx'' and ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' must have been able to fly to some degree, as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been marine or lake sediments, suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water.&lt;ref name=sciencefeatherdebate&gt;Balter, M.

[http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/05/did-first-feathers-prevent-early.html &quot;Did First Feathers Prevent Early Flight?&quot;] ''Science Now'', 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Paul]] also disagreed with the study, arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the masses of these early birds, and that more accurate mass estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises. Nudds and Dyke had assumed a mass of {{convert|250|g|abbr=on}} for the Munich specimen ''Archaeopteryx'', a young juvenile, based on published mass estimates of larger specimens. Paul argued that a more reasonable body mass estimate for the Munich specimen is about {{convert|140|g|abbr=on}}. Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves, noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved. Nudds and Dyke reported a diameter of {{convert|0.75|mm|abbr=on|+2}} for the longest primary feather, which Paul could not confirm using photographs. Paul measured some of the inner primary feathers, finding rachises {{convert|1.25–1.4|mm|abbr=on}} across.&lt;ref name=paul2010&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Paul |first1= G.

They claimed that Paul's statement, that an adult ''Archaeopteryx'' would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen, was dubious. This, they reasoned, would require an even thicker rachis, evidence for which has not yet been presented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nudds&amp;Dyke_October2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dyke |first1=G.

[[File:Archaeopteryx lithographica, replica of London specimen, Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Karlsruhe, Germany - 20100925.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Replica of the London Specimen]]

In 2004, scientists analysing a detailed [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] of the [[braincase]] of the London ''Archaeopteryx'' concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination.&lt;ref name=Witmer_1/&gt; The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that ''Archaeopteryx'' had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly.&lt;ref name=Alonso/&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% of the way to modern birds from the condition of non-[[coelurosaurian]] dinosaurs such as ''[[Carcharodontosaurus]]'' or ''[[Allosaurus]]'', which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larsson2001&quot;&gt;Larsson, H.

H.; Carpenter, K.; Skrepnick, M. W. (eds.) ''Mesozoic Vertebrate Life''. Indiana University Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;19–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Newer research shows that while the ''Archaeopteryx'' brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among [[maniraptoran|Maniraptora]] dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature12424|pmid=23903660|title=Evolutionary origins of the avian brain|journal=Nature|volume=501|issue=7465|pages=93–6|year=2013|last1=Balanoff|first1=Amy M.|last2=Bever|first2=Gabe S.|last3=Rowe|first3=Timothy B.|last4=Norell|first4=Mark A.|bibcode=2013Natur.501...93B}}

Recent studies of flight feather barb geometry reveal that modern birds possess a larger barb angle in the trailing vane of the feather, whereas ''Archaeopteryx'' lacks this large barb angle, indicating potentially weak flight abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Barb geometry of asymmetrical feathers reveals a transitional morphology in the evolution of avian flight|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 22 March 2015|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 4345455|pmid = 25673687|page = 20142864|volume = 282|issue = 1803|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.2864|first = Teresa J.|last = Feo|first2 = Daniel J.|last2 = Field|first3 = Richard O.|last3 = Prum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Archaeopteryx Philadelphia.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed skeleton, [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University]]]]
''Archaeopteryx'' continues to play an important part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds. Some scientists see it as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the &quot;trees down&quot; hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O. C. Marsh]]). Other scientists see ''Archaeopteryx'' as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the &quot;ground up&quot; hypothesis proposed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]]). Still others suggest that ''Archaeopteryx'' might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground, like modern crows, and this latter view is what currently is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching. A scenario outlined by Elżanowski in 2002 suggested that ''Archaeopteryx'' used its wings mainly to escape [[Predation|predators]] by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, and alternatively, to cover longer distances (mainly) by gliding down from cliffs or treetops.&lt;ref name=Elzanowski2002/&gt;

A study on ''Archaeopteryx'''s bone histology suggests that it was closest to true flying birds, and in particular to pheasants and other burst flyers.&lt;ref&gt;Voeten, Dennis F.A.E.; et al. (13 March 2018). “Wing bone geometry reveals active flight in Archaeopteryx”. Nature Communications. 9 (923). Bibcode:2018NatCo…9..923V. doi:10.1038/s41467–018–03296–8.

=== Growth ===
[[File:Archaeopteryx growth curve.jpg|thumb|left|Growth trends compared with other dinosaurs and birds]]

A [[histological]] study by Erickson, Norell, Zhongue, and others in 2009 estimated that ''Archaeopteryx'' grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, presumably because the outermost portions of ''Archaeopteryx'' bones appear poorly vascularized;&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt; in living vertebrates, poorly vascularized bone is correlated with slow growth rate. They also assume that all known skeletons of ''Archaeopteryx'' come from juvenile specimens. Because the bones of ''Archaeopteryx'' could not be histologically sectioned in a formal skeletochronological (growth ring) analysis, Erickson and colleagues used bone vascularity (porosity) to estimate bone growth rate. They assumed that poorly vascularized bone grows at similar rates in all birds and in ''Archaeopteryx''. The poorly vascularized bone of ''Archaeopteryx'' might have grown as slowly as that in a mallard (2.5 micrometres per day) or as fast as that in an ostrich (4.2 micrometres per day). Using this range of bone growth rates, they calculated how long it would take to &quot;grow&quot; each specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' to the observed size; it may have taken at least 970 days (there were 375 days in a Late Jurassic year) to reach an adult size of {{convert|0.8–1|kg|abbr=on}}. The study also found that the avialans ''[[Jeholornis]]'' and ''[[Sapeornis]]'' grew relatively slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid ''[[Mahakala (dinosaur)|Mahakala]]''. The avialans ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' and ''[[Ichthyornis]]'' grew relatively quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds.&lt;ref&gt;''EurekAlert!'' (8 October 2009), [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-10/amon-wn100809.php &quot;''Archaeopteryx'' was not very bird-like&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few modern birds that exhibit slow growth is the flightless [[kiwi]], and the authors speculated that ''Archaeopteryx'' and the kiwi had similar [[basal metabolic rate]].&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt;

=== Daily activity patterns ===
Comparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral ring]]s of ''Archaeopteryx'' and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been [[Diurnality|diurnal]], similar to most modern birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Schmitz, L. |author2=Motani, R. |year=2011 |title=Nocturnality in Dinosaurs Inferred from Scleral Ring and Orbit Morphology |journal=Science |volume=332 |issue= 6030|pages= 705–8|doi=10.1126/science.1200043|bibcode = 2011Sci...332..705S |pmid=21493820|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8922c462d9cd7f64033fe9989f5a1dc0e7e8aac9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paleoecology ==
[[File:Archaeopteryx lithographica by durbed.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''Archaeopteryx'' chasing a juvenile ''[[Compsognathus]]'']]
The richness and diversity of the [[Solnhofen limestone]]s in which all specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' have been found have shed light on an ancient Jurassic Bavaria strikingly different from the present day. The latitude was similar to [[Florida]], though the climate was likely to have been drier, as evidenced by fossils of plants with adaptations for arid conditions and a lack of terrestrial sediments characteristic of rivers. Evidence of plants, although scarce, include [[cycad]]s and conifers while animals found include a large number of insects, small lizards, [[pterosaur]]s, and ''[[Compsognathus]]''.&lt;ref name=Chiappe_07/&gt;

The excellent preservation of ''Archaeopteryx'' fossils and other terrestrial fossils found at [[Solnhofen]] indicates that they did not travel far before becoming preserved.&lt;ref name=Davis_1/&gt; The ''Archaeopteryx'' specimens found were therefore likely to have lived on the low islands surrounding the Solnhofen lagoon rather than to have been corpses that drifted in from farther away. ''Archaeopteryx'' skeletons are considerably less numerous in the deposits of Solnhofen than those of pterosaurs, of which seven genera have been found.&lt;ref name=Bartell_90/&gt; The pterosaurs included species such as ''[[Rhamphorhynchus (pterosaur)|Rhamphorhynchus]]'' belonging to the [[Rhamphorhynchidae]], the group which dominated the [[Ecological niche|niche]] currently occupied by [[seabird]]s, and which became extinct at the end of the Jurassic. The pterosaurs, which also included ''[[Pterodactylus]]'', were common enough that it is unlikely that the specimens found are [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]] from the larger islands {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north.&lt;ref name=Paul_1/&gt;

The islands that surrounded the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying, [[semi-arid]], and sub-[[tropical]] with a long [[dry season]] and little rain.&lt;ref name=Buison/&gt; The closest modern analogue for the Solnhofen conditions is said to be [[Orca Basin]] in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], although it is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons.&lt;ref name=Bartell_90/&gt; The [[flora]] of these islands was adapted to these dry conditions and consisted mostly of low ({{convert|3|m|abbr=on|0}}) shrubs.&lt;ref name=Paul_1/&gt; Contrary to reconstructions of ''Archaeopteryx'' climbing large trees, these seem to have been mostly absent from the islands; few trunks have been found in the sediments and fossilized tree [[pollen]] also is absent.

The lifestyle of ''Archaeopteryx'' is difficult to reconstruct and there are several theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground,&lt;ref name=Ostrom_3/&gt; while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal on the basis of the curvature of the claws&lt;ref name=&quot;Feduc 1&quot;/&gt; which has since been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pike|first=A. V. L.|last2=Maitland|first2=D.

Various aspects of the morphology of ''Archaeopteryx'' point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon.&lt;ref name=Paul_1/&gt; It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.

The first skeleton, known as the '''London Specimen''' (BMNH 37001),&lt;ref name=BMNH_37001/&gt; was unearthed in 1861 near [[Langenaltheim]], Germany, and perhaps given to local physician Karl Häberlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for £700 to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, where it remains.&lt;ref name=Chiappe_07/&gt; Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by [[Richard Owen]] as ''Archaeopteryx macrura'', allowing for the possibility it did not belong to the same species as the feather. In the subsequent fourth edition of his ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'',&lt;ref name=Darwin_1/&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] described how some authors had maintained &quot;that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the ''Archaeopteryx'', with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Darwin_2/&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term &quot;pteryx&quot; ({{lang|el|πτέρυξ}}) primarily means &quot;wing&quot;, but can also designate merely &quot;feather&quot;. Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a single feather which appeared to resemble a modern bird's [[Flight feather|remex]] (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the [[London]] specimen, to which he referred as a &quot;''Skelett eines mit ähnlichen Federn bedeckten {{lang|de|Tieres}}''&quot; (&quot;skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers&quot;). In German, this ambiguity is resolved by the term ''Schwinge'' which does not necessarily mean a wing used for flying. ''Urschwinge'' was the favoured translation of ''Archaeopteryx'' among German scholars in the late nineteenth century. In English, &quot;ancient pinion&quot; offers a rough approximation.

Since then twelve specimens have been recovered:

The '''Berlin Specimen''' (HMN 1880/81) was discovered in 1874 or 1875 on the Blumenberg near [[Eichstätt]], Germany, by farmer Jakob Niemeyer. He sold this precious [[fossil]] for the money to buy a cow in 1876, to innkeeper Johann Dörr, who again sold it to Ernst Otto Häberlein, the son of K. Häberlein. Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881, with potential buyers including [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O. C. Marsh]] of [[Yale University]]'s Peabody Museum, it eventually was bought for 20,000 [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] by the Berlin's Natural History Museum, where it now is displayed. The transaction was financed by [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]], founder of the [[Siemens AG|famous company]] that bears his name.&lt;ref name=Chiappe_07/&gt; Described in 1884 by [[Wilhelm Dames]], it is the most complete specimen, and the first with a complete head. In 1897 it was named by Dames as a new species, ''A. siemensii''; though often considered a synonym of ''A. lithographica'', several 21st century studies have concluded that it is a distinct species which includes the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens.&lt;ref name=Elzanowski2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=10th_find/&gt;
[[File:Archaeopteryx lithographica (Cast of Maxberg Specimen).jpg|upright|thumb|Cast of the Maxberg Specimen]]
Composed of a torso, the '''[[Maxberg specimen|Maxberg Specimen]]''' (S5) was discovered in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it was brought to the attention of professor [[Florian Heller]] in 1958 and described by him in 1959. The specimen is missing its head and tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact. Although it was once exhibited at the [[Maxberg Museum]] in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to [[Eduard Opitsch]], who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it was discovered that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.

The '''Haarlem Specimen''' (TM 6428/29, also known as the ''Teylers Specimen'') was discovered in 1855 near [[Riedenburg]], Germany, and described as a ''[[Pterodactylus]] crassipes'' in 1857 by Meyer. It was reclassified in 1970 by [[John Ostrom]] and is currently located at the [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands. It was the very first specimen found, but was incorrectly classified at the time. It is also one of the least complete specimens, consisting mostly of limb bones, isolated cervical vertebrae, and ribs. In 2017 it was named as a separate genus ''[[Ostromia]]'', considered more closely related to ''[[Anchiornis]]'' from China.&lt;ref name=&quot;desc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foth | first1 = C. | last2 = Rauhut | first2 = O.W.M. | title = Re-evaluation of the Haarlem Archaeopteryx and the radiation of maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | page = 236 | date = 2017 | doi = 10.1186/s12862-017-1076-y | pmid = 29197327 | pmc = 5712154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Archaeopteryx lithographica (Eichstätter Specimen).jpg|thumb|left|Eichstätt Specimen, once considered a distinct genus, ''Jurapteryx'']]
The '''Eichstätt Specimen''' (JM 2257) was discovered in 1951 near Workerszell, Germany, and described by [[Peter Wellnhofer]] in 1974. Currently located at the [[Jura Museum]] in [[Eichstätt]], Germany, it is the smallest known specimen and has the second best head. It is possibly a separate genus (''Jurapteryx recurva'') or species (''A. recurva'').

The '''Solnhofen Specimen''' (unnumbered specimen) was discovered in the 1970s near [[Eichstätt]], Germany, and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the [[Bürgermeister-Müller-Museum]] in Solnhofen, it originally was classified as ''[[Compsognathus]]'' by an amateur collector, the same mayor Friedrich Müller after which the museum is named. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, ''[[Wellnhoferia]] grandis''. It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.

The '''Munich Specimen''' (BSP 1999 I 50, formerly known as the ''Solenhofer-Aktien-Verein Specimen'') was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. It is currently located at the [[Paläontologisches Museum München]] in Munich, to which it was sold in 1999 for 1.9 million [[Deutschmark]]. What was initially believed to be a bony [[sternum]] turned out to be part of the [[coracoid]],&lt;ref name=Wellnhofer/&gt; but a [[cartilaginous]] sternum may have been present. Only the front of its face is missing. It has been used as the basis for a distinct species, ''A. bavarica'',&lt;ref&gt;Wellnhofer, Peter. ''Archaeopteryx. Der Urvogel Von Solnhofen''. München: Friedrich Pfeil, 2008, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent studies suggest it belongs to ''A. siemensii''.&lt;ref name=10th_find/&gt;
[[File:Archaeopteryx (Daiting Specimen).jpg|thumb|Daiting Specimen, the holotype of ''A. albersdoerferi'']]
An eighth, fragmentary specimen was discovered in 1990 in the younger [[Mörnsheim Formation]] at [[Daiting]], Suevia. Therefore, it is known as the '''Daiting Specimen''', and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in [[Bamberg]]. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009.&lt;ref name=Sensation/&gt; It was on display for the first time with six other original fossils of ''Archaeopteryx'' at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009.&lt;ref name=Sammler/&gt; The Daiting Specimen was subsequently named ''Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi'' by Kundrat et al. (2018).&lt;ref name=Wiedergefundener/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/08912963.2018.1518443|title=The first specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' from the Upper Jurassic Mörnsheim Formation of Germany|journal=Historical Biology|volume=31|pages=3–63|year=2019|last1=Kundrát|first1=Martin|last2=Nudds|first2=John|last3=Kear|first3=Benjamin P.|last4=Lü|first4=Junchang|last5=Ahlberg|first5=Per}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Archaeopteryx (Chicken Wing).jpg|thumb|left|Bürgermeister-Müller (&quot;chicken wing&quot;) Specimen]]
Another fragmentary fossil was found in 2000. It is in private possession and, since 2004, on loan to the Bürgermeister-Müller Museum in Solnhofen, so it is called the '''Bürgermeister-Müller Specimen'''; the institute itself officially refers to it as the &quot;Exemplar of the families Ottman &amp; Steil, Solnhofen&quot;. As the fragment represents the remains of a single wing of ''Archaeopteryx'', the popular name of this fossil is &quot;chicken wing&quot;.

Long in a private collection in Switzerland, the '''Thermopolis Specimen''' (WDC CSG 100) was discovered in Bavaria and described in 2005 by Mayr, Pohl, and Peters. Donated to the [[Wyoming Dinosaur Center]] in [[Thermopolis, Wyoming]], it has the best-preserved head and feet; most of the neck and the lower jaw have not been preserved. The &quot;Thermopolis&quot; specimen was described in 2 December 2005 ''Science'' journal article as &quot;A well-preserved ''Archaeopteryx'' specimen with theropod features&quot;; it shows that  ''Archaeopteryx'' lacked a reversed toe—a universal feature of birds—limiting its ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk-climbing lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Mayr_1/&gt; This has been interpreted as evidence of [[Theropoda|theropod]] ancestry. In 1988, [[Gregory S. Paul]] claimed to have found evidence of a hyperextensible second toe, but this was not verified and accepted by other scientists until the Thermopolis specimen was described.&lt;ref name=Paul_1988/&gt; &quot;Until now, the feature was thought to belong only to the species' close relatives, the deinonychosaurs.&quot;&lt;ref name=Natgeo1/&gt; The Thermopolis Specimen was assigned to ''Archaeopteryx siemensii'' in 2007.&lt;ref name=10th_find/&gt; The specimen is considered to represent the most complete and best-preserved ''Archaeopteryx'' remains yet.&lt;ref name=10th_find/&gt;
[[File:Archaeopteryx Nummer 11.jpg|alt=|thumb|The eleventh specimen]]
The discovery of an eleventh specimen was announced in 2011, and it was described in 2014. It is one of the more complete specimens, but is missing much of the skull and one forelimb. It is privately owned and has yet to be given a name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/dinosaur/2011/10/paleontologists-unveil-the-11th-archaeopteryx/ |title=Paleontologists Unveil the 11th Archaeopteryx |work=Dinosaur Tracking Blog |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |date=19 October 2011 |first=Brian |last=Switek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2011/10/stunning-new-archaeopteryx-fos.html |title=Another stunning Archaeopteryx fossil found in Germany |journal=New Scientist|date=20 October 2011 |first=Jeff |last=Hecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
[[File:Thermopolis Archaeopteryx.jpg|thumb|left|The Thermopolis Specimen]]
Today, fossils of the genus ''Archaeopteryx'' are usually assigned to one or two species, ''A. lithographica'' and ''A. siemensii'', but their taxonomic history is complicated. Ten names have been published for the handful of specimens. As interpreted today, the name ''A. lithographica'' only referred to the single feather described by [[Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer|Meyer]]. In 1954 [[Gavin de Beer]] concluded that the London specimen was the [[holotype]]. In 1960, Swinton accordingly proposed that the name ''Archaeopteryx lithographica'' be placed on the official genera list making the alternative names ''Griphosaurus'' and ''Griphornis'' invalid.&lt;ref name=Swinton/&gt; The [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]], implicitly accepting de Beer's standpoint, did indeed suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens,&lt;ref name=ICZN_1961/&gt; which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between Meyer and his opponent [[Johann Andreas Wagner]] (whose ''Griphosaurus problematicus'' – &quot;problematic [[riddle]]-lizard&quot; – was a vitriolic sneer at Meyer's ''Archaeopteryx'').&lt;ref name=Wagner_1/&gt; In addition, in 1977, the Commission ruled that the first species name of the Haarlem specimen, ''crassipes'', described by Meyer as a [[pterosaur]] before its true nature was realized, was not to be given preference over ''lithographica'' in instances where scientists considered them to represent the same species.&lt;ref name=UCal_MoP/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICZN_1977/&gt;

It has been noted that the feather, the first specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of ''Archaeopteryx''. It certainly is a [[flight feather]] of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of [[feathered dinosaur|feathered theropod]], of which only this feather is known so far.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; As the feather had been designated the [[Biological type|type specimen]], the name ''Archaeopteryx'' should then no longer be applied to the skeletons, thus creating significant [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|nomenclatorial]] confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or [[neotype]].&lt;ref name=icznneotype&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bock | first1 = W.

=== Species ===
[[File:Archaeopteryx skeletals.jpg|thumb|350px|Skeletal restorations of various specimens]]
It has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species, ''A. lithographica''.&lt;ref name=New_Scientist_1/&gt; Differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as ''Archaeornis siemensii'', the Eichstätt specimen as ''Jurapteryx recurva'', the Munich specimen as ''Archaeopteryx bavarica'', and the Solnhofen specimen as ''Wellnhoferia grandis''.&lt;ref name=Elzanowski2002/&gt;

In 2007, a review of all well-preserved specimens including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of ''Archaeopteryx'' could be supported: ''A. lithographica'' (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens), and ''A. siemensii'' (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in ''A. lithographica'' (the claws of ''A. siemensii'' specimens being relatively simple and straight). ''A. lithographica'' also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. A supposed additional species, ''Wellnhoferia grandis'' (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from ''A. lithographica'' except in its larger size.&lt;ref name=10th_find/&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Authenticity ===
Beginning in 1985, an amateur group including [[astronomer]] [[Fred Hoyle]] and [[physicist]] [[Lee Spetner]] published a series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' were forged.&lt;ref name=Hoyle_85/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSW_85a/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSW_85b/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSW_85c/&gt; Their claims were repudiated by [[Alan J. Charig]] and others at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum in London]].&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; Most of their supposed evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of [[lithification]]; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of [[cement]],&lt;ref name=RSW_85a/&gt; without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather,&lt;ref name=RSW_85a/&gt; when visibly this is not the case.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' known at the time did not have feathers,&lt;ref name=Hoyle_85/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSW_85a/&gt; which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt;

They also expressed disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that one half of a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the [[counterslab]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyle_85&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RSW_85b&quot; /&gt; These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave the bulk of the fossil on one side and little on the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACetal86&quot; /&gt;

Finally, the motives they suggested for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; one is that [[Richard Owen]] wanted to forge evidence in support of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Talk_Origin_1&quot; /&gt;

Charig ''et al.'' pointed to the presence of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; Spetner ''et al.'' then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer,&lt;ref name=LMS88/&gt; but neglected to account for the fact that the cracks were old and had been filled with [[calcite]], and thus were not able to propagate.&lt;ref name=Talk_Origin_1/&gt; They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through [[X-ray spectroscopy]], and did find something that was not rock;&lt;ref name=LMS88/&gt; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen.&lt;ref name=Talk_Origin_1/&gt; Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig ''et al.'' reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities.&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt; They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt;

Modern paleontology has often classified ''Archaeopteryx'' as the most primitive bird. It is not thought to be a true ancestor of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that ancestor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&amp;Norell2002&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, ''Archaeopteryx'' was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so.&lt;ref name=Witmer02/&gt; Lowe (1935)&lt;ref name=Lowe_1935/&gt; and Thulborn (1984)&lt;ref name=Thulborn_1984/&gt; questioned whether ''Archaeopteryx'' truly was the first bird. They suggested that ''Archaeopteryx'' was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that ''[[Avimimus]]'' was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than ''Archaeopteryx''.&lt;ref name=Kurzanov_1987/&gt; Barsbold (1983)&lt;ref name=Barsbold_1983/&gt; and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997)&lt;ref name=&quot;Zweers&amp;VandenBerge1997&quot;/&gt; noted that many [[maniraptora]]n lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.

The discovery of the closely related ''[[Xiaotingia]]'' in 2011 led to new phylogenetic analyses that suggested that ''Archaeopteryx'' is a [[deinonychosaur]] rather than an avialan, and therefore, not a &quot;bird&quot; under most common uses of that term.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xiaotingia&quot; /&gt; A more thorough analysis was published soon after to test this hypothesis, and failed to arrive at the same result; it found ''Archaeopteryx'' in its traditional position at the base of Avialae, while ''Xiaotingia'' was recovered as a basal dromaeosaurid or troodontid. The authors of the follow-up study noted that uncertainties still exist, and that it may not be possible to state confidently whether or not ''Archaeopteryx'' is a member of Avialae or not, barring new and better specimens of relevant species.&lt;ref name=&quot;leeetal2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012 |title=Likelihood reinstates ''Archaeopteryx'' as a primitive bird |journal=Biology Letters |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=299–303 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2011.0884 |pmid=22031726 |pmc=3297401 |last1=Lee |first1=M.

Phylogenetic studies conducted by Senter, ''et al.'' (2012) and Turner, Makovicky, and Norell (2012) confirmed that ''Archaeopteryx'' was more closely related to living birds than to dromaeosaurids and troodontids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Senter |first=Phil |author2=Kirkland, James I.|author3=DeBlieux, Donald D.|author4=Madsen, Scott|author5=Toth, Natalie|year=2012 |title=New Dromaeosaurids (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Utah, and the Evolution of the Dromaeosaurid Tail |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e36790 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036790 |editor1-last=Dodson |editor1-first=Peter |pmid=22615813 |pmc=3352940 |bibcode = 2012PLoSO...736790S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TurneretalBAMNH&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = A review of dromaeosaurid systematics and paravian phylogeny | journal = Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume = 371 | pages = 1–206 | doi = 10.1206/748.1 | last1 = Turner | first1 = Alan H. | last2 = Makovicky | first2 = Peter J. | last3 = Norell | first3 = Mark A. | hdl = 2246/6352 | url = http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/bitstream/2246/6352/5/B371-cover.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Godefroit, ''et al.'' (2013) recovered ''Archaeopteryx'' as more closely related to dromaeosaurids and troodontids in the analysis included in their description of ''[[Eosinopteryx|Eosinopteryx brevipenna]]''. The authors used a modified version of the matrix from the study describing ''Xiaotingia'', adding ''[[Jinfengopteryx|Jinfengopteryx elegans]]'' and ''Eosinopteryx brevipenna'' to it, as well as adding four additional characters related to the development of the plumage. Unlike the analysis from the description of ''Xiaotingia'', the analysis conducted by Godefroit, ''et al.'' did not find ''Archaeopteryx'' to be related particularly closely to ''Anchiornis'' and ''Xiaotingia'', which were recovered as basal troodontids instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2013 |title=Reduced plumage and flight ability of a new Jurassic paravian theropod from China |journal=Nature Communications |volume=4 |issue= |pages=Article number 1394 |doi=10.1038/ncomms2389 |pmid=23340434|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.1394G |last1=Godefroit |first1=P |last2=Demuynck |first2=H |last3=Dyke |first3=G |last4=Hu |first4=D |last5=Escuillié |first5=F |last6=Claeys |first6=P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnolín and Novas (2013) found ''Archaeopteryx'' and (possibly synonymous) ''[[Wellnhoferia]]'' to be the basalmost avialans (Avialae being defined by the authors as including ''Archaeopteryx lithographica'' and ''[[Passer]]'', their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants), with [[Microraptoria]], [[Unenlagiinae]], and the clade containing ''Anchiornis'' and ''Xiaotingia'' being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae.&lt;ref name=&quot;avianancestry&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|year=2013 |title=Avian ancestors.

''Archaeopteryx'' was found to form a [[Evolutionary grade|grade]] at the base of Avialae with ''Xiaotingia'', ''Anchiornis'', and ''[[Aurornis]]''. Compared to ''Archaeopteryx'', ''Xiaotingia'' was found to be more closely related to extant birds, while both ''Anchiornis'' and ''[[Aurornis]]'' were found to be more distantly so.&lt;ref name=&quot;pascal&quot; /&gt;
